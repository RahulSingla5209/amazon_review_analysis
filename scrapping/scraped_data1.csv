Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Fake Jacket,1.0,"The jacket I received is a fake.  I also ordered a tall to compared the lengths.  See pictures.  The tall jacket is on the left off the 1st 3 pics and the bottom on the last.  The fake jacket does not have Columbia embroidered, it is a sticker of some sort.  Also the tag on the inside is different as with the ""Omni-tech"" on the sleeve.  The fake jacket does not have ""Packable"" on the inside of the pocket.  The jacket appears nice and I would have not questioned its authenticity if I didn't have the tall jacket to compare.  I am returning it."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Columbia or Amazon couldn't verify counterfeit,1.0,"Based on the other reviews I couldn't verify if the item I received was authentic or counterfeit. I got a replacement and both items had a non embroidered chest logo, missing packable tag in the pocket, and a non diamond omnitech logo on the left sleeve.I called Columbia and the best they could do is verify that the product number on the tag matched the number in their system, which it did. They couldn't address the concerns listed above.I contacted Amazon and they also couldn't verify if the product was authentic or counterfeit and will open an investigation."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Nicely Made (and a word for you if you're on the L/XL line),5.0,"I am on the border of large and x-large with most my clothes (36"" give or take waist). From other reviews, I read it's a little big, so decided to size down and went for the large. It fits nice with a t-shirt underneath, but not a lot of extra room for my... ugh... expanded mid section.  With a fleece mid-layer, it's a bit snug me. So if you're right on that L/XL line in most your clothing due to an over-indulgence in yummy trail treats and plan to wear over thicker clothing, I'd go with the XL.  But if you plan to be using it as a summer raincoat over just a tee for hiking and so on (that's my plan with it), then I'd go with the L.  It's really that fine of a line for me."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,NOT Waterproof at all!!!,1.0,"I bought this to go hiking on the Inca trail in Peru.  Even though it was rainy season, luckily we had no rain.But, then I took it on a trip to NYC where I wore it during a rainstorm on the way to a house lunch.  Was dry for the 15 minute walk in light but steady rain.  Hung the jack up to dry.  When I went to put back on the jacket, the moisture had SOAKED ALL THE WAY THROUGH the entire jacket.  Like putting on a wet washcloth.  Very disappointing.The jacket looks nice, feels well, but most sincerely very NOT WATERPROOF AT ALL.Never washed or did anything with jacket.Seller:  If you think I got a bum jacket, please let me know.  Would try another to see if works."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Great jacket!!,5.0,"My husband loves this jacket. It is actually waterproof. My husband mountain bikes as a hobby and he volunteers to build the trails. Rainy days are the best trail building days and he said this jacket kept him completely dry while he was working in the rain for hours. On sizing if you are barely a large size down to a medium. The large runs big. My husband is 5'10"" 170lbs and medium fits him perfect. The large fit my brother inlaw perfectly and he is 6' 220lbs for reference."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Incrediblé jacket,5.0,"Had this jacket for about a month now and all I can say is it's awesome! Perfect for rain and a pretty damn good wind breaker as well. I can't say it's completely waterproof because I haven't been in a monsoon rainstorm but it's kept me dry for every other rain storm. Also it packs up so if you don't need it right now but maybe later for like a camping trip or something you can pull it out and put it on.Instructions: the left pocket has a label inside that says ""packable"" turn that guy inside out and stuff the rest of the jacket on in there.About the size of a normal picture 6""x4"" and the width of maybe 3-4"" probably depends on how well you stuff it in there. Hope this helps!"
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,More Than a Rain Jacket,5.0,"A Review of the Columbia Men’s Watertight Rain JacketThe Columbia Men’s Watertight Rain Jacket is a lightweight waterproof jacket with a slim design. As the name suggests, the jacket is very much capable of keeping you dry on a rainy day; however, its value goes way beyond a rain coat. Here are several features that make this jacket a wonderful addition to your wardrobe.Waterproof and WindproofThis jacket is truly waterproof. It helps you stay clean and dry even in the pouring rain. With the waterproof technology comes the wonderful stain repellent feature. No matter how dirty the jacket gets during a rainy day, a simple wipe is enough to take care of it. The windproof feature provides an extra protection against the cold. Meanwhile, the fabric is still breathable that it allows moisture vapor to move away from the skin. The only downside is that the waterproof feature can post difficulty when it comes to washing this jacket. You may find a pouch of water when you take it out of the washer. An extra cycle of drying will take care of the issue if this ever occurs.DesignThis jacket is lined with a soft layer of mesh and is very light weight. The longer arm length and body length provide enough coverage to keep you dry no matter how hard the wind is blowing. The hood comes out far enough forward to shield your face while the drawstring helps keep the hood on even in strong wind. Two front pockets with zipper are big enough to protect a phone, a wallet, a set of keys, and even a pair of gloves from getting rained on. The slim design delivers a more modern look than its competitors, helping you keep the style even on an awfully crummy day. Meanwhile, the jacket is still generous with space around your chest so that you always have enough room for a sweater or a hoodie or even a coat. Another notable feature is that the entire jacket can be packed into the front left pocket, which comes with a double-sided zipper.VersatilityFew jackets are as versatile as this one. The waterproof and windproof features make this jacket practically perfect for a fishing trip. The breathable fabric makes sure that you can throw this jacket over your favorite tee on a rainy day in the middle of the summer. You can also layer up under this jacket for fall or winter use. The matt finish and the slick look ensure that no one knows you are using a rain jacket as a spring/fall windbreaker. You can also use this jacket to protect your pea coat from getting wet on a snow day.Overall, the Columbia Men’s Watertight Rain Jacket is a high quality jacket that can be worn in many occasions. It surely has room for improvements. But for the price you are paying, you can hardly find a better deal than this."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,It's waterproof and keeps the wind out while being lightweight.,5.0,"I bought this jacket for my husband who is 5'10' and about 200 lbs.  It's a bit roomy as I wanted him to be able to fit a fleece jacket under it when needed.  It is loose enough without being baggy to look good with or without the fleece.  He's worn it a bit likes the feel and says it keeps the wind out.  It finally rained to test out the waterproof part - it's waterproof all right!  We stood out in the rain about 4 hrs, some of it was drizzle, most a steady rain. His shirt was dry when he took the jacket off.  His only wish was the hood was a bit stiffer at the top.  He said it kind of plastered around his head instead of creating a hood that stood out a bit.  His solution is to get a baseball hat and that will keep the rain off his face.  I would buy it again for sure!"
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Doesn’t appear authentic,1.0,"The jacket doesn’t appear to be authentic. It doesn’t have Columbia embroidered on the front and the sleeve like as on an original, it is more like a iron onto shirt like sticker of some sort. Also the tag on the inside is different like a general cloth label which doesn’t have the Columbia brand and QR code like on the original. Same goes for the ""Omni-tech"" on the sleeve. This jacket does not have ""Packable"" pocket on the inside of the left pocket with a label. Also like many customers reviewed, these jackets are oversized. Maybe good for people who live in colder climate wearing layers. For petiole living in temperate climate areas I would suggest you order one or two size smaller. This The jacket appears nice but I would not have paid this much if I wanted a regular unbranded jacket."

The hood comes out far enough forward to shield your face while the drawstring helps keep the hood on even in strong wind. Two front pockets with zipper are big enough to protect a phone, a wallet, a set of keys, and even a pair of gloves from getting rained on. The slim design delivers a more modern look than its competitors, helping you keep the style even on an awfully crummy day. Meanwhile, the jacket is still generous with space around your chest so that you always have enough room for a sweater or a hoodie or even a coat. Another notable feature is that the entire jacket can be packed into the front left pocket, which comes with a double-sided zipper.VersatilityFew jackets are as versatile as this one. The waterproof and windproof features make this jacket practically perfect for a fishing trip. The breathable fabric makes sure that you can throw this jacket over your favorite tee on a rainy day in the middle of the summer. You can also layer up under this jacket for fall or winter use. The matt finish and the slick look ensure that no one knows you are using a rain jacket as a spring/fall windbreaker. You can also use this jacket to protect your pea coat from getting wet on a snow day.Overall, the Columbia Men’s Watertight Rain Jacket is a high quality jacket that can be worn in many occasions. It surely has room for improvements. But for the price you are paying, you can hardly find a better deal than this."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,It's waterproof and keeps the wind out while being lightweight.,5.0,"I bought this jacket for my husband who is 5'10' and about 200 lbs.  It's a bit roomy as I wanted him to be able to fit a fleece jacket under it when needed.  It is loose enough without being baggy to look good with or without the fleece.  He's worn it a bit likes the feel and says it keeps the wind out.  It finally rained to test out the waterproof part - it's waterproof all right!  We stood out in the rain about 4 hrs, some of it was drizzle, most a steady rain. His shirt was dry when he took the jacket off.  His only wish was the hood was a bit stiffer at the top.  He said it kind of plastered around his head instead of creating a hood that stood out a bit.  His solution is to get a baseball hat and that will keep the rain off his face.  I would buy it again for sure!"

This jacket does not have ""Packable"" pocket on the inside of the left pocket with a label. Also like many customers reviewed, these jackets are oversized.

Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,More Than a Rain Jacket,5.0,"A Review of the Columbia Men’s Watertight Rain JacketThe Columbia Men’s Watertight Rain Jacket is a lightweight waterproof jacket with a slim design. As the name suggests, the jacket is very much capable of keeping you dry on a rainy day; however, its value goes way beyond a rain coat. Here are several features that make this jacket a wonderful addition to your wardrobe.Waterproof and WindproofThis jacket is truly waterproof.

So if you're right on that L/XL line in most your clothing due to an over-indulgence in yummy trail treats and plan to wear over thicker clothing, I'd go with the XL.  But if you plan to be using it as a summer raincoat over just a tee for hiking and so on (that's my plan with it), then I'd go with the L.  It's really that fine of a line for me."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,NOT Waterproof at all!!!,1.0,"I bought this to go hiking on the Inca trail in Peru.

Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,More Than a Rain Jacket,5.0,"A Review of the Columbia Men’s Watertight Rain JacketThe Columbia Men’s Watertight Rain Jacket is a lightweight waterproof jacket with a slim design. As the name suggests, the jacket is very much capable of keeping you dry on a rainy day; however, its value goes way beyond a rain coat. Here are several features that make this jacket a wonderful addition to your wardrobe.Waterproof and WindproofThis jacket is truly waterproof. It helps you stay clean and dry even in the pouring rain. With the waterproof technology comes the wonderful stain repellent feature. No matter how dirty the jacket gets during a rainy day, a simple wipe is enough to take care of it. The windproof feature provides an extra protection against the cold. Meanwhile, the fabric is still breathable that it allows moisture vapor to move away from the skin. The only downside is that the waterproof feature can post difficulty when it comes to washing this jacket. You may find a pouch of water when you take it out of the washer. An extra cycle of drying will take care of the issue if this ever occurs.DesignThis jacket is lined with a soft layer of mesh and is very light weight. The longer arm length and body length provide enough coverage to keep you dry no matter how hard the wind is blowing. The hood comes out far enough forward to shield your face while the drawstring helps keep the hood on even in strong wind. Two front pockets with zipper are big enough to protect a phone, a wallet, a set of keys, and even a pair of gloves from getting rained on. The slim design delivers a more modern look than its competitors, helping you keep the style even on an awfully crummy day. Meanwhile, the jacket is still generous with space around your chest so that you always have enough room for a sweater or a hoodie or even a coat. Another notable feature is that the entire jacket can be packed into the front left pocket, which comes with a double-sided zipper.VersatilityFew jackets are as versatile as this one. The waterproof and windproof features make this jacket practically perfect for a fishing trip. The breathable fabric makes sure that you can throw this jacket over your favorite tee on a rainy day in the middle of the summer. You can also layer up under this jacket for fall or winter use. The matt finish and the slick look ensure that no one knows you are using a rain jacket as a spring/fall windbreaker. You can also use this jacket to protect your pea coat from getting wet on a snow day.Overall, the Columbia Men’s Watertight Rain Jacket is a high quality jacket that can be worn in many occasions. It surely has room for improvements. But for the price you are paying, you can hardly find a better deal than this."
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,It's waterproof and keeps the wind out while being lightweight.,5.0,"I bought this jacket for my husband who is 5'10' and about 200 lbs.  It's a bit roomy as I wanted him to be able to fit a fleece jacket under it when needed.  It is loose enough without being baggy to look good with or without the fleece.  He's worn it a bit likes the feel and says it keeps the wind out.  It finally rained to test out the waterproof part - it's waterproof all right!  We stood out in the rain about 4 hrs, some of it was drizzle, most a steady rain. His shirt was dry when he took the jacket off.  His only wish was the hood was a bit stiffer at the top.  He said it kind of plastered around his head instead of creating a hood that stood out a bit.  His solution is to get a baseball hat and that will keep the rain off his face.  I would buy it again for sure!"
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Doesn’t appear authentic,1.0,"The jacket doesn’t appear to be authentic. It doesn’t have Columbia embroidered on the front and the sleeve like as on an original, it is more like a iron onto shirt like sticker of some sort. Also the tag on the inside is different like a general cloth label which doesn’t have the Columbia brand and QR code like on the original. Same goes for the ""Omni-tech"" on the sleeve. This jacket does not have ""Packable"" pocket on the inside of the left pocket with a label. Also like many customers reviewed, these jackets are oversized. Maybe good for people who live in colder climate wearing layers. For petiole living in temperate climate areas I would suggest you order one or two size smaller. This The jacket appears nice but I would not have paid this much if I wanted a regular unbranded jacket."

Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,It's waterproof and keeps the wind out while being lightweight.,5.0,"I bought this jacket for my husband who is 5'10' and about 200 lbs.  It's a bit roomy as I wanted him to be able to fit a fleece jacket under it when needed.  It is loose enough without being baggy to look good with or without the fleece.  He's worn it a bit likes the feel and says it keeps the wind out.  It finally rained to test out the waterproof part - it's waterproof all right!  We stood out in the rain about 4 hrs, some of it was drizzle, most a steady rain. His shirt was dry when he took the jacket off.  His only wish was the hood was a bit stiffer at the top.  He said it kind of plastered around his head instead of creating a hood that stood out a bit.  His solution is to get a baseball hat and that will keep the rain off his face.  I would buy it again for sure!"
Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Doesn’t appear authentic,1.0,"The jacket doesn’t appear to be authentic. It doesn’t have Columbia embroidered on the front and the sleeve like as on an original, it is more like a iron onto shirt like sticker of some sort.

This jacket does not have ""Packable"" pocket on the inside of the left pocket with a label. Also like many customers reviewed, these jackets are oversized. Maybe good for people who live in colder climate wearing layers. For petiole living in temperate climate areas I would suggest you order one or two size smaller.

Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Nicely Made (and a word for you if you're on the L/XL line),5.0,"I am on the border of large and x-large with most my clothes (36"" give or take waist).

It fits nice with a t-shirt underneath, but not a lot of extra room for my... ugh... expanded mid section.  With a fleece mid-layer, it's a bit snug me. So if you're right on that L/XL line in most your clothing due to an over-indulgence in yummy trail treats and plan to wear over thicker clothing, I'd go with the XL.  But if you plan to be using it as a summer raincoat over just a tee for hiking and so on (that's my plan with it), then I'd go with the L.  It's really that fine of a line for me."

Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,More Than a Rain Jacket,5.0,"A Review of the Columbia Men’s Watertight Rain JacketThe Columbia Men’s Watertight Rain Jacket is a lightweight waterproof jacket with a slim design. As the name suggests, the jacket is very much capable of keeping you dry on a rainy day; however, its value goes way beyond a rain coat. Here are several features that make this jacket a wonderful addition to your wardrobe.Waterproof and WindproofThis jacket is truly waterproof. It helps you stay clean and dry even in the pouring rain. With the waterproof technology comes the wonderful stain repellent feature. No matter how dirty the jacket gets during a rainy day, a simple wipe is enough to take care of it. The windproof feature provides an extra protection against the cold. Meanwhile, the fabric is still breathable that it allows moisture vapor to move away from the skin. The only downside is that the waterproof feature can post difficulty when it comes to washing this jacket. You may find a pouch of water when you take it out of the washer. An extra cycle of drying will take care of the issue if this ever occurs.DesignThis jacket is lined with a soft layer of mesh and is very light weight. The longer arm length and body length provide enough coverage to keep you dry no matter how hard the wind is blowing. The hood comes out far enough forward to shield your face while the drawstring helps keep the hood on even in strong wind. Two front pockets with zipper are big enough to protect a phone, a wallet, a set of keys, and even a pair of gloves from getting rained on. The slim design delivers a more modern look than its competitors, helping you keep the style even on an awfully crummy day. Meanwhile, the jacket is still generous with space around your chest so that you always have enough room for a sweater or a hoodie or even a coat. Another notable feature is that the entire jacket can be packed into the front left pocket, which comes with a double-sided zipper.VersatilityFew jackets are as versatile as this one. The waterproof and windproof features make this jacket practically perfect for a fishing trip. The breathable fabric makes sure that you can throw this jacket over your favorite tee on a rainy day in the middle of the summer. You can also layer up under this jacket for fall or winter use. The matt finish and the slick look ensure that no one knows you are using a rain jacket as a spring/fall windbreaker. You can also use this jacket to protect your pea coat from getting wet on a snow day.Overall, the Columbia Men’s Watertight Rain Jacket is a high quality jacket that can be worn in many occasions. It surely has room for improvements. But for the price you are paying, you can hardly find a better deal than this."

URBANFIND Men's Slim Fit Lightweight Sportswear Jacket Casual Bomber Jacket,Light weight slim-fit bomber jacket,5.0,Great light weight slim fit bomber. The material isn't all shiny like other bomber jackets. No exterior logos or weird decals. Definitely getting your money's worth with this purchase. Has interior flask pocket that can fit a cell phone with a 6 inch display no problem. It's thin so I don't recommend for extreme cold weather. This is more of a jacket for when you wanna look good and clean.  My chest is a size 40 and I'm 6'1. I purchased the large and it fit perfect to my preference. (See attached photos)
URBANFIND Men's Slim Fit Lightweight Sportswear Jacket Casual Bomber Jacket,Order one size up from your normal size,5.0,"I read the reviews and verified the sizing chart which helped. I'm 5'5 160lbs and the large fit me perfectly. The jacket isn't too thin or too thick, but exactly what I was looking for."
URBANFIND Men's Slim Fit Lightweight Sportswear Jacket Casual Bomber Jacket,Sizes must have been adjusted - Order the sie you normally would,4.0,"I saw all the reviews from 2018, saying that the sizes run smaller than usual, however, I ordered a Large (I was a large T-Shirt) and the jacket fit me like I'd expect a large jacket to. However, I like my jackets snug, so I would prefer a medium.Many of the reviews recommend you go a size up, but I don't think that's needed anymore.4 stars because the zipper is SUPER bright and shiny against the black fabric, and it just LOOKS really cheap. Feels nice, with a bit of warmth. If I'd gotten a medium, and the zipper wasnt to so shiny, I would have been perfectly happy."
URBANFIND Men's Slim Fit Lightweight Sportswear Jacket Casual Bomber Jacket,Almost...,4.0,"Jacket is lightweight, looks cool and feels well-made. It's definitely made for an average or slimmer build, though. For reference, I'm 5'6"" and 175lbs (mostly muscle). Using the one-size-up advice, I ordered an XL. Overall it actually looks pretty good. But it's a little snug across the chest/shoulders. So if you're about 5'6"" with an average build (and not broad shoulders) an XL will probably for you perfectly.I must warn though: the jacket does not have very much flex in it at all. If I were to buy it again I'd order 2 sizes up and get it tailored. Just my two cents."

Tommy Hilfiger Men's Classic Zip Front Polar Fleece Jacket,"Warm & Smart looking, But the sleeves run long",4.0,"The Tommy Hilfiger is a smart looking looking fleece jacket that looks great on jeans and is is pretty warm and cozy as well. The fleece material is thicker and of better quality than what  you would typically find in a Fruit of the Loom or a Hanes Fleece Jacket. It fits well around the chest and has sufficient length , the only issue is that its sleeves run a bit long. I had to fold them up to use them  for my L sized jacket(I usually wear Large) . I've included the main measurements of this jacket for its 'Large' size in case you'd like to refer for sizingDESIGN & QUALITY- Full sleeved zippered jacket with a turtle neck & no hoodie- Two zippered front pockets as well as two inner pockets on either side- The turtle neck collar is double layered- The zippers glide smoothly and feel that they are of good quality- The piped design/stitching that runs across the chest and back looks much better in real life than in pictures alone and adds to its overall smart looks- Both the exterior and interior pockets are deep enough to fit wallets, keys , large cellphonesDIMENSIONS (SIZE: LARGE)Sleeves  :27"" InchesShoulder  :6.5"" InchesLength  :29.5"" InchesWidth chest  :24"" InchesTHE GOOD:- Smart looking jacket that pairs well with jeans and contrasting t-shirts , whether you zip half or all the way up- The thick fleece material and the double layered turtle neck makes the jacket very warm and cozy - sufficient for 48F ~ 50F weather without any additional layers- 4 Pockets and smooth flowing zippers- Fits well around the chestTHE NOT SO GOOD- The sleeves run long , I had to fold them in my day to day use (see pics)- The fleece + black color of my jacket is a magnet for lint and hair, an important consideration if you have pets (common with most fleece jackets)- The tags in the neck area can be bothersome if you're wearing round neck t-shirts- For these reasons I take away one starFINAL THOUGHTSOverall the Tommy Hilfiger fleece jacket is very smart looking, warm to wear and is better in terms of quality than other common brands. The only thing I would recommend considering is that the sleeves tend to run long and that it does attract a lot of lint and hair"
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Classic Zip Front Polar Fleece Jacket,Stay away from this jacket,1.0,Stay away from this jacket... I purchased this jacket on the December 10 2019 and the Zipper is already falling apart. I lost 3 teeth already and the side pockets jam all the time. If I didn't know any better I would think this jacket is counterfeit. This is not the Tommy Hilfiger Quality
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Classic Zip Front Polar Fleece Jacket,Disappointed at the quality,2.0,"Now that the weather has turned cold, I've had a chance to wear this jacket a few times.  It looks nice and is warm enough, but the zipper is barely functional.  The quality is really poor and I expect it to not last very long.  The jacket is serviceable, but the quality is not what I have enjoyed with Tommy Hilfiger products and I suspect that it might be another of a long line of Amazon knock-offs.  Either way, I am disappointed and will be more careful about where I purchase apparel in the future."
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Classic Zip Front Polar Fleece Jacket,good fleece for long arms,4.0,"Great thick fleece. Warm. Good to 32 f in short duration. Great for 45+ long termSoft, comfortable, well made.Good fit in chest. I am 6' 195, 46"" chest, 36"" waist. 17 neck 34 sleeve.Very long sleeve on this, only negative. Covers most of my hand. Probably made for the tall alien's from close encounters movie. an under-served market i suspect.Other than that, great for the price."
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Classic Zip Front Polar Fleece Jacket,Runs big,5.0,"This full zip sweater runs big but after getting a size smaller, it fits perfectly. Love the quality and thickness of the material. Im 5'8 180lbs usually wear a M but size Small here fits great for me"
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Classic Zip Front Polar Fleece Jacket,Zipper Broke after 3 uses!,1.0,Zipper broke after wearing the jacket for just 3 times.I bought this jacket for my husband so that he could wear it winter but the zipper broke right after. I accepted better quality from Tommy!
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Classic Zip Front Polar Fleece Jacket,Not the fit I was looking for,3.0,"I'm approximately 5'10"" and 160lb. For reference a Columbia or Calvin Klein medium fit me perfectly. The arms on this are extremely baggy and hang down over my hands. The bottom of the fleece and arms also lack any sort of elastic to keep them snug. It has a very loose fit overall. The jacket is warm and the fleece is fluffy but the main zipper feels cheap. I personally will stick to other brands in the future."
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Classic Zip Front Polar Fleece Jacket,Could be better,3.0,"I'd give this 5 stars except for 2 things.  First, there is no elastic in the sleeves, and no way to adjust them, so the sleeves constantly fall down over my hands.  Secondly, this material is the kind that attracts hair, so if there are animals around, you will be covered."
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Classic Zip Front Polar Fleece Jacket,Perfect gift for my 16 year old nephew,5.0,"Bought the large for my 16 year old nephew. He absolutely loves it (the red one) and is always finding reasons to wear a jacket in Florida. It looks well fitted, the material is quite posh, and the small (not flashy) logo makes it perfect for young and young but well seasoned."
Tanming Men's Casual Slim Fit Lightweight Zip Up Softshell Bomber Jacket,"Cheap materials, runs small, no shoulder taper",3.0,"I ordered this jacket as part of a Star Lord costume for Halloween. I figured it would make a nice windbreaker afterwards with how nice it looked on the picture. Upon arrival I immediately noticed some undesirable things. For one the color is a couple shades lighter than what the picture shows. And there is absolutely no padding in the shoulders nor are the shoulders sewn to give you any sort of shape like what is shown in the picture. That's not a bad thing if you have broad shoulders, but it can be disillusioning to see yourself wearing a scrunched up red coat if you don't. The biggest issues I faced were the material and the size though. The material was cheap and sounded/looked like I was wearing a big red trash bag. As for the size, I'm broad shouldered and have a fairly large chest but this item runs thin; very New York fashion. So if you do decide to order, make sure you go a size or two above what you think you are."
Tanming Men's Casual Slim Fit Lightweight Zip Up Softshell Bomber Jacket,"Stylish, light, and affordable jacket",5.0,"I was skeptical when the package was delivered because the jacket was pretty thin in the delivery bag, but I was pleased when I opened it up and saw how nice it was.Definitely a light jacket that does not provide much warmth, but stylish and great for the price!

The jacket we received has a bright purple patterned lining that’s really unattractive with the red color jacket, but if you wear it zipped the whole time this becomes kind of a nonissue.-As other reviewers have mentioned, the color is more of a bright red than the darker red pictured.-The jacket is also definitely thin. I would agree with another reviewer that it’s a cheap plastic material not far off from a trash bag but again - for a costume, it’s fine."

Tanming Men's Casual Slim Fit Lightweight Zip Up Softshell Bomber Jacket,Very Stylish & Beautiful Jacket!!!,5.0,"This a very nice jacket, I am 6'2"" 265 and the XXL fit me nicely. I received the jacket on the same day that I attended a friends B-day party and received numerous compliments. People wanted to know where I purchased it. I just ordered the same jacket in black yesterday. Living in the Northeast, this is going to be a great fall jacket to wear with a turtleneck, t-shirt or dress shirt. I love this jacket!"
Tanming Men's Casual Slim Fit Lightweight Zip Up Softshell Bomber Jacket,"Cheap materials, runs small, no shoulder taper",3.0,"I ordered this jacket as part of a Star Lord costume for Halloween. I figured it would make a nice windbreaker afterwards with how nice it looked on the picture. Upon arrival I immediately noticed some undesirable things. For one the color is a couple shades lighter than what the picture shows. And there is absolutely no padding in the shoulders nor are the shoulders sewn to give you any sort of shape like what is shown in the picture. That's not a bad thing if you have broad shoulders, but it can be disillusioning to see yourself wearing a scrunched up red coat if you don't. The biggest issues I faced were the material and the size though. The material was cheap and sounded/looked like I was wearing a big red trash bag. As for the size, I'm broad shouldered and have a fairly large chest but this item runs thin; very New York fashion. So if you do decide to order, make sure you go a size or two above what you think you are."

Confortable, warm, and fits great. Only thing is I don't like the design on the tricept area, looks wierd with the krisscross stitching. Otherwise no problems with it."

Tanming Men's Casual Slim Fit Lightweight Zip Up Softshell Bomber Jacket,Very Stylish & Beautiful Jacket!!!,5.0,"This a very nice jacket, I am 6'2"" 265 and the XXL fit me nicely. I received the jacket on the same day that I attended a friends B-day party and received numerous compliments. People wanted to know where I purchased it. I just ordered the same jacket in black yesterday. Living in the Northeast, this is going to be a great fall jacket to wear with a turtleneck, t-shirt or dress shirt. I love this jacket!"
Tanming Men's Casual Slim Fit Lightweight Zip Up Softshell Bomber Jacket,"Cheap materials, runs small, no shoulder taper",3.0,"I ordered this jacket as part of a Star Lord costume for Halloween. I figured it would make a nice windbreaker afterwards with how nice it looked on the picture. Upon arrival I immediately noticed some undesirable things. For one the color is a couple shades lighter than what the picture shows. And there is absolutely no padding in the shoulders nor are the shoulders sewn to give you any sort of shape like what is shown in the picture. That's not a bad thing if you have broad shoulders, but it can be disillusioning to see yourself wearing a scrunched up red coat if you don't. The biggest issues I faced were the material and the size though. The material was cheap and sounded/looked like I was wearing a big red trash bag. As for the size, I'm broad shouldered and have a fairly large chest but this item runs thin; very New York fashion. So if you do decide to order, make sure you go a size or two above what you think you are."
Tanming Men's Casual Slim Fit Lightweight Zip Up Softshell Bomber Jacket,"Stylish, light, and affordable jacket",5.0,"I was skeptical when the package was delivered because the jacket was pretty thin in the delivery bag, but I was pleased when I opened it up and saw how nice it was.Definitely a light jacket that does not provide much warmth, but stylish and great for the price! Used initially for a starlord costume, and has already been used for casual wear. Great and affordable light jacket, looks really great on."
Tanming Men's Casual Slim Fit Lightweight Zip Up Softshell Bomber Jacket,Looks exactly as pictured.,5.0,"Looks exactly like the photo. I was nervous based on the other reviews, but I’m very pleased.

Tanming Men's Casual Slim Fit Lightweight Zip Up Softshell Bomber Jacket,Good quality and price,5.0,"Looks great, just like in the photos. Especially great for the price, most of these cheaper sellers on Amazon sacrifice quality but that’s not the case here. Just like a department store brand."
Tanming Men's Casual Slim Fit Lightweight Zip Up Softshell Bomber Jacket,Good for costume but not as pictured,3.0,"I ordered this for my husband for our family’s Guardians of the Galaxy Halloween costumes. I think if I had ordered for casual wear I would be a lot more disappointed but for a Star Lord costume it’s a good price and the quality is decent for photos and trick or treating.-My husband has broad shoulders and an athletic build; this fit him true to size-The lining is not as pictured. The jacket we received has a bright purple patterned lining that’s really unattractive with the red color jacket, but if you wear it zipped the whole time this becomes kind of a nonissue.-As other reviewers have mentioned, the color is more of a bright red than the darker red pictured.-The jacket is also definitely thin. I would agree with another reviewer that it’s a cheap plastic material not far off from a trash bag but again - for a costume, it’s fine."

He has not tried it on yet, he will in a bit, but I can already tell the large will be a bit roomier on him. He has really long arms so my concern is whether this will cover his arms. If the body fits well, usually the sleeves are a few inches too short. He does typically wear Large. The stitching looks fine, don’t see anything wrong with it. I do agree that the material is not actually fleece, it’s fleece-like. Feels thin but warm. Isn’t super fluffy, which is fine. My order says made in Bangladesh, which the reviews keep saying is the better quality zip-up in comparison to the ones that say made in China.If I don’t forget, I will update the review once he wears it a few times and once it’s washed to see how it holds up. But so far, other than it being fleece-like, it looks great for the price.I don’t know if it’s real Columbia though. I typically wear north face fleeces so I don’t even know what Columbia’s fleeces feel like. I doubt it’s the real thing.UPDATE 12.29.18: it fits him well, it’s very warm. He wears it almost every day when it’s colder outside. Has been washed a few times, still looks fantastic. Did lose the shiny new look after being washed, but it still does the job. We ended up buying the same one except black at TJMaxx for his brother for Christmas. Sometimes I wear it myself because it’s big and cozy; perfect for chilly days or lazy mornings."

I don't believe they have much difference in style. But I got packets with zippers and draw string at the Hem. those might be the updates of the 2.0. I wasn't expecting zip pockets."
Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Fake!,1.0,"This is a counterfeit Columbia fleece. First off, not fleece, secondly, it smells like chemicals, third the tag is sewn on the front and not embroidered, the zipper pulls are not the ones Columbia uses. I’ve seen fake North Face Fleeces on eBay but never from something as inexpensive as Columbia.  The material is so cheap I bet it won’t last through more than 2 washes and will pill up immediately. Also smells like it gives you cancer."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,A pox on pizza theif.,5.0,"Good jacket. Pretty warm, you will need to layer if you're getting into temperatures under literal freezing. That's 0°C/32°F, for those who dropped out of junior high. It definitely retains heat when zipped up. I wouldn't wear this if it's 70+. You'll get sweaty quick. Lots of pockets. Fits well, the black will show dirt pretty quick. I really liked this thing. It is made in China, for those whom it may concern. This jacket is so good, in fact, that some copulator of maternal figures had to go and swipe it while I had it in the break room at work. I bet it was the same guy that stole my pizza out of the fridge, and just left the crust in the box as if I wouldn't notice."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,SIZE UP FOR BIG SHOULDERS!!!,5.0,"It fits well, I'm normally a 2XT, but after reading the reviews, I decided on the 3XT. A bit big, but good through the shoulders. So when I layer it'll work out fine. It's just a bit big through the middle.Otherwise, a very well made and comfortable jacket. I'm going to wear it this morning, only 23° outside!!I highly recommend this jacket! But your normal size unless you have wide shoulders like me from sports my whole life!"
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Well-made mostly winter jacket,5.0,"I believe clothes shopping with my 15 yr old son to guage size, fit, and likeability in multiple stores my own personal circle of hell. There's a lot of deep breathing exercises. And in comes Amazon. This coat really impressed me when it arrived. Wasn't sure it would be warm enough. My son all of a sudden despised the Columbia type winter jackets. Wanted more, I don't know, lived in style. Think Beatnik practical. I humored him (anything to keep from going back into the hell of clothes shopping) and was really impressed. This coat is heavy. Seriously. Thick and lined. The price is great for a name brand item and the product you receive. Keeps my nightmare inducing offspring warm and we live in Idaho with stupid single digit weather for weeks. You live closer to Canada, may wanna consider a parka. This won't cut it. Oh! And for reference. He's 5'7"", lanky but really filled out because of weight training. The medium fits beautifully."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,"Great Fit, Durable Material",5.0,"I was skeptical at first about this jacket, but boy was I blown away when I got it. This jacket is the real deal. I am 6'1"" 160 lbs and the medium fits me perfectly. The body of the jacket is lined with a type of fur and the pockets are lined with fleece (perfect for my cold hands!). The  material a kind of durable cotton, super tough. The hoodie is nice and big so it fits over my head all the way (A lot of jackets I've seen have tiny hoods that don't fit). The hoodie part is removable, but I don't think I'll ever remove it. Everything about this jacket is super durable and I am very happy with it."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,GREAT COAT,5.0,"Coat was $45 because it was a return “like new”. I always buy things when that are on wish list when Amazon lowers the moolah after someone returns the item without proper packaging, labels or something that really doesn’t have anything to do with item. I’ve found that the % Amazon lowers is all over the place on different items, some high, some low. On this coat the regular price was $68 bucks and I got it for $44 so I saves me some good samoleons.  Ok ok why am I wasting your time telling you how I save $$$$$ on this coat? If something you want has “almost new” buy it if it’s a great savings because I’ve done this a lot and never found the item has anything wrong. another example a pair of work boots that I saved 45%."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,I ordered black and got.... a very very dark navy? Or is it black? I have no idea!,3.0,"I'm rating this 3 stars, not because the jacket doesn't fit well or look good, but because I'm not sure if I got the right color!Let me start off with the good: This jacket is AWESOME! The feeling of it on is very comfortable and is a perfect fit for my body (Broad shoulders @ 6'0"" 170lbs) and looks absolutely amazing. I've never had a jacket that I felt looked this good. Genuinely! The interior lining is comfy, the pocket is quite deep, the hood can easily be removed, and can easily be worn on the daily!Now the bad (I won't be mentioning the color issue here since that's not a fault of the jacket itself): My levis logo on my chest pocket seems to have gotten hit by a bit of dye during manufacturing and comes off as low quality when you look at it (pictured). I'm sure this could easily be fixed so I'm honestly not too annoyed with this. The armpit area is actually quite tight. Personally, I've always had this issue with medium-sized jackets so I honestly don't blame the jacket for this, it's simply my body type. Something to know if you're thinking of buying this, though. Overall, these issues really don't bother me and wouldn't stop me from ever buying this jacket again!The reason I've subtracted 2 stars: The label on the interior of the jacket does indeed say ""NVY"" in its color ID. However, the label on the bag says black. DOUBLE HOWEVER, upon close examination of the sticker that's underneath the other inventory stickers, it states that this jacket is originally a navy jacket (pictured)! Although... everyone I've asked has said the jacket looks black to them but does have a bit of blue in there. I'm honestly not 100% sure this is black or not. To me, it looks very black but does have a smidge of blue in it and could possibly pass as a navy jacket, perhaps in broad daylight. This might be difficult to see in the pictures so I guess you'll just have to take my word for it.As of right now (9/8/2020) I've contacted Amazon support (Amazon was the seller in this scenario) and have arranged for a replacement which should be here in a few days. If the replacement is a genuine black label and it still looks the same, I'll tally this up to an error in the factory and be done with it. I'll be sure to post a few pictures of it on myself as well so people can get an idea of what it looks like on my body type!"
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Great Jacket **two things to note,4.0,"I love this jacket (with two small caveats), but overall it is great!I am 5' 11"" at 165 lbs and the medium was a very good fit. I would say that anyone more than a couple inches taller than me should probably get a large because of the length.Bottom line is I would definitely recommend this jacket if you are ok with two minor things to be aware of (see below).Pros:~The jacket is very warm, with fleece-lined pockets (which is nice for cold hands) and it stands up to wind very well~Very good build quality - all seems feel very good and I don't see any messy stiching~Good, metal zippers and cord stops~Good fit for someone with an athletic to moderate frame (I usually find jackets too large in the stomach and too small in the shoulders, but this jacket is very good)~Looks much better than a standard winter coat for wearing to school, events, etcCons:~The color in the photos is NOT the color I received (ordered khaki, but mine is much darker, almost army green) - see photo~During normal use, the inside sleeve material has a tendency to fold out past the end of the sleeves. I have tried ironing them and pulling them back into the jacket, but they always end up like this after a day of wearing. - see second photoIf these two things don't bother you then go for it!"
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Amazon selling a batch of factory defects?,1.0,"I'm now returning my 3rd jacket.When I first ordered the jacket, the buttons were installed too close to the zipper such that the zipper was snagging on the buttons. Definitely a defect, so I sent it back with no hassle through Amazon.My replacement was defective too, however. There were no buttons on the cuffs, the sleeves felt shorter, and the inside polyester material protruded, all of which looked noticeably ""off"" to people who hadn't even seen the proper construction of the jacket. Also, the two pockets over the top of the buttoned pockets on the front of the jacket were sewn shut (or non-existent). Since my first jacket had both of these things right (if not the buttons), I knew this one was defective as well. So I sent it back.The third jacket I received was the same as the second. So now I'm sending it back again.I'm thankful for Amazon's painless returns, but it really seems like they're selling the Levi's factory defects. It's incredibly frustrating to think that winter might be over before I even get a good jacket."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,"Weird fit for tall, skinnier guys.",3.0,"I'll start by saying I'm about 6'1 and 170lbs, athletic/slender. I ordered a large because I like to layer in cold weather. From the pictures of the model wearing it and the reviews, I expected this coat to be a little more form fitting, but so far it seems a little boxy. It is also a lot shorter than I expected. It sits right at my belt. If I zip it and lift my arms shoulder height, it comes up above my belt. If I lift my arms over my head, it rises above my belly button. Also seems loose in the lower back, which will allow cold air in for sure. It fits well otherwise.. chest, shoulders and arms are comfortable. There's about a $60 difference between what I paid for the large and the large-tall size, so I may end up just returning it."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,This jacket had potential,4.0,"The jacket is decent, I actually purchased two of them in the color navy/size medium. First thing I did was run it through the washer/warm water & threw it in the dryer/hot cycle & the shrinkage was very minimal but noticeable & fit me a bit too snug, I did stretch the jacket out a bit with my hands, manually & was successful in doing so. Am slim/fit 5’11 & 155 pounds, pants size 30x32 & the jacket sat slightly below my waist, not wide or baggy, just snug, sleeve length seemed normal, the jacket is restrictive in the shoulder area, don’t raise your arms. I don’t ever recommend going a size up or down but, that’s just me personally. The inside of the jacket is made up of some kind of rough furry material, the roughness was kinda disappointing. The jacket overall looks good, with or without the hoodie, the hoodie is removable. The jacket is neither light or heavy."

Am slim/fit 5’11 & 155 pounds, pants size 30x32 & the jacket sat slightly below my waist, not wide or baggy, just snug, sleeve length seemed normal, the jacket is restrictive in the shoulder area, don’t raise your arms. I don’t ever recommend going a size up or down but, that’s just me personally. The inside of the jacket is made up of some kind of rough furry material, the roughness was kinda disappointing. The jacket overall looks good, with or without the hoodie, the hoodie is removable. The jacket is neither light or heavy."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,A pox on pizza theif.,5.0,"Good jacket. Pretty warm, you will need to layer if you're getting into temperatures under literal freezing. That's 0°C/32°F, for those who dropped out of junior high. It definitely retains heat when zipped up. I wouldn't wear this if it's 70+. You'll get sweaty quick. Lots of pockets. Fits well, the black will show dirt pretty quick. I really liked this thing. It is made in China, for those whom it may concern. This jacket is so good, in fact, that some copulator of maternal figures had to go and swipe it while I had it in the break room at work. I bet it was the same guy that stole my pizza out of the fridge, and just left the crust in the box as if I wouldn't notice."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,SIZE UP FOR BIG SHOULDERS!!!,5.0,"It fits well, I'm normally a 2XT, but after reading the reviews, I decided on the 3XT. A bit big, but good through the shoulders. So when I layer it'll work out fine. It's just a bit big through the middle.Otherwise, a very well made and comfortable jacket. I'm going to wear it this morning, only 23° outside!!I highly recommend this jacket! But your normal size unless you have wide shoulders like me from sports my whole life!"
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Well-made mostly winter jacket,5.0,"I believe clothes shopping with my 15 yr old son to guage size, fit, and likeability in multiple stores my own personal circle of hell. There's a lot of deep breathing exercises. And in comes Amazon. This coat really impressed me when it arrived. Wasn't sure it would be warm enough. My son all of a sudden despised the Columbia type winter jackets. Wanted more, I don't know, lived in style. Think Beatnik practical. I humored him (anything to keep from going back into the hell of clothes shopping) and was really impressed. This coat is heavy. Seriously. Thick and lined. The price is great for a name brand item and the product you receive. Keeps my nightmare inducing offspring warm and we live in Idaho with stupid single digit weather for weeks. You live closer to Canada, may wanna consider a parka. This won't cut it. Oh! And for reference. He's 5'7"", lanky but really filled out because of weight training. The medium fits beautifully."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,"Great Fit, Durable Material",5.0,"I was skeptical at first about this jacket, but boy was I blown away when I got it. This jacket is the real deal. I am 6'1"" 160 lbs and the medium fits me perfectly. The body of the jacket is lined with a type of fur and the pockets are lined with fleece (perfect for my cold hands!). The  material a kind of durable cotton, super tough. The hoodie is nice and big so it fits over my head all the way (A lot of jackets I've seen have tiny hoods that don't fit). The hoodie part is removable, but I don't think I'll ever remove it. Everything about this jacket is super durable and I am very happy with it."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,GREAT COAT,5.0,"Coat was $45 because it was a return “like new”. I always buy things when that are on wish list when Amazon lowers the moolah after someone returns the item without proper packaging, labels or something that really doesn’t have anything to do with item. I’ve found that the % Amazon lowers is all over the place on different items, some high, some low. On this coat the regular price was $68 bucks and I got it for $44 so I saves me some good samoleons.  Ok ok why am I wasting your time telling you how I save $$$$$ on this coat? If something you want has “almost new” buy it if it’s a great savings because I’ve done this a lot and never found the item has anything wrong. another example a pair of work boots that I saved 45%."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,I ordered black and got.... a very very dark navy? Or is it black? I have no idea!,3.0,"I'm rating this 3 stars, not because the jacket doesn't fit well or look good, but because I'm not sure if I got the right color!Let me start off with the good: This jacket is AWESOME! The feeling of it on is very comfortable and is a perfect fit for my body (Broad shoulders @ 6'0"" 170lbs) and looks absolutely amazing. I've never had a jacket that I felt looked this good. Genuinely! The interior lining is comfy, the pocket is quite deep, the hood can easily be removed, and can easily be worn on the daily!Now the bad (I won't be mentioning the color issue here since that's not a fault of the jacket itself): My levis logo on my chest pocket seems to have gotten hit by a bit of dye during manufacturing and comes off as low quality when you look at it (pictured). I'm sure this could easily be fixed so I'm honestly not too annoyed with this. The armpit area is actually quite tight. Personally, I've always had this issue with medium-sized jackets so I honestly don't blame the jacket for this, it's simply my body type. Something to know if you're thinking of buying this, though. Overall, these issues really don't bother me and wouldn't stop me from ever buying this jacket again!The reason I've subtracted 2 stars: The label on the interior of the jacket does indeed say ""NVY"" in its color ID. However, the label on the bag says black. DOUBLE HOWEVER, upon close examination of the sticker that's underneath the other inventory stickers, it states that this jacket is originally a navy jacket (pictured)! Although... everyone I've asked has said the jacket looks black to them but does have a bit of blue in there. I'm honestly not 100% sure this is black or not. To me, it looks very black but does have a smidge of blue in it and could possibly pass as a navy jacket, perhaps in broad daylight. This might be difficult to see in the pictures so I guess you'll just have to take my word for it.As of right now (9/8/2020) I've contacted Amazon support (Amazon was the seller in this scenario) and have arranged for a replacement which should be here in a few days. If the replacement is a genuine black label and it still looks the same, I'll tally this up to an error in the factory and be done with it. I'll be sure to post a few pictures of it on myself as well so people can get an idea of what it looks like on my body type!"
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Great Jacket **two things to note,4.0,"I love this jacket (with two small caveats), but overall it is great!I am 5' 11"" at 165 lbs and the medium was a very good fit. I would say that anyone more than a couple inches taller than me should probably get a large because of the length.Bottom line is I would definitely recommend this jacket if you are ok with two minor things to be aware of (see below).Pros:~The jacket is very warm, with fleece-lined pockets (which is nice for cold hands) and it stands up to wind very well~Very good build quality - all seems feel very good and I don't see any messy stiching~Good, metal zippers and cord stops~Good fit for someone with an athletic to moderate frame (I usually find jackets too large in the stomach and too small in the shoulders, but this jacket is very good)~Looks much better than a standard winter coat for wearing to school, events, etcCons:~The color in the photos is NOT the color I received (ordered khaki, but mine is much darker, almost army green) - see photo~During normal use, the inside sleeve material has a tendency to fold out past the end of the sleeves. I have tried ironing them and pulling them back into the jacket, but they always end up like this after a day of wearing. - see second photoIf these two things don't bother you then go for it!"
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Amazon selling a batch of factory defects?,1.0,"I'm now returning my 3rd jacket.When I first ordered the jacket, the buttons were installed too close to the zipper such that the zipper was snagging on the buttons. Definitely a defect, so I sent it back with no hassle through Amazon.My replacement was defective too, however. There were no buttons on the cuffs, the sleeves felt shorter, and the inside polyester material protruded, all of which looked noticeably ""off"" to people who hadn't even seen the proper construction of the jacket. Also, the two pockets over the top of the buttoned pockets on the front of the jacket were sewn shut (or non-existent). Since my first jacket had both of these things right (if not the buttons), I knew this one was defective as well. So I sent it back.The third jacket I received was the same as the second. So now I'm sending it back again.I'm thankful for Amazon's painless returns, but it really seems like they're selling the Levi's factory defects. It's incredibly frustrating to think that winter might be over before I even get a good jacket."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,"Weird fit for tall, skinnier guys.",3.0,"I'll start by saying I'm about 6'1 and 170lbs, athletic/slender. I ordered a large because I like to layer in cold weather. From the pictures of the model wearing it and the reviews, I expected this coat to be a little more form fitting, but so far it seems a little boxy. It is also a lot shorter than I expected. It sits right at my belt. If I zip it and lift my arms shoulder height, it comes up above my belt. If I lift my arms over my head, it rises above my belly button. Also seems loose in the lower back, which will allow cold air in for sure. It fits well otherwise.. chest, shoulders and arms are comfortable. There's about a $60 difference between what I paid for the large and the large-tall size, so I may end up just returning it."

Am slim/fit 5’11 & 155 pounds, pants size 30x32 & the jacket sat slightly below my waist, not wide or baggy, just snug, sleeve length seemed normal, the jacket is restrictive in the shoulder area, don’t raise your arms. I don’t ever recommend going a size up or down but, that’s just me personally. The inside of the jacket is made up of some kind of rough furry material, the roughness was kinda disappointing. The jacket overall looks good, with or without the hoodie, the hoodie is removable. The jacket is neither light or heavy."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,A pox on pizza theif.,5.0,"Good jacket. Pretty warm, you will need to layer if you're getting into temperatures under literal freezing. That's 0°C/32°F, for those who dropped out of junior high. It definitely retains heat when zipped up. I wouldn't wear this if it's 70+. You'll get sweaty quick. Lots of pockets. Fits well, the black will show dirt pretty quick. I really liked this thing. It is made in China, for those whom it may concern. This jacket is so good, in fact, that some copulator of maternal figures had to go and swipe it while I had it in the break room at work. I bet it was the same guy that stole my pizza out of the fridge, and just left the crust in the box as if I wouldn't notice."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,SIZE UP FOR BIG SHOULDERS!!!,5.0,"It fits well, I'm normally a 2XT, but after reading the reviews, I decided on the 3XT. A bit big, but good through the shoulders. So when I layer it'll work out fine. It's just a bit big through the middle.Otherwise, a very well made and comfortable jacket. I'm going to wear it this morning, only 23° outside!!I highly recommend this jacket! But your normal size unless you have wide shoulders like me from sports my whole life!"
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Well-made mostly winter jacket,5.0,"I believe clothes shopping with my 15 yr old son to guage size, fit, and likeability in multiple stores my own personal circle of hell. There's a lot of deep breathing exercises. And in comes Amazon. This coat really impressed me when it arrived. Wasn't sure it would be warm enough. My son all of a sudden despised the Columbia type winter jackets. Wanted more, I don't know, lived in style. Think Beatnik practical. I humored him (anything to keep from going back into the hell of clothes shopping) and was really impressed. This coat is heavy. Seriously. Thick and lined. The price is great for a name brand item and the product you receive. Keeps my nightmare inducing offspring warm and we live in Idaho with stupid single digit weather for weeks. You live closer to Canada, may wanna consider a parka. This won't cut it. Oh! And for reference. He's 5'7"", lanky but really filled out because of weight training. The medium fits beautifully."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,"Great Fit, Durable Material",5.0,"I was skeptical at first about this jacket, but boy was I blown away when I got it. This jacket is the real deal. I am 6'1"" 160 lbs and the medium fits me perfectly. The body of the jacket is lined with a type of fur and the pockets are lined with fleece (perfect for my cold hands!). The  material a kind of durable cotton, super tough. The hoodie is nice and big so it fits over my head all the way (A lot of jackets I've seen have tiny hoods that don't fit). The hoodie part is removable, but I don't think I'll ever remove it. Everything about this jacket is super durable and I am very happy with it."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,GREAT COAT,5.0,"Coat was $45 because it was a return “like new”. I always buy things when that are on wish list when Amazon lowers the moolah after someone returns the item without proper packaging, labels or something that really doesn’t have anything to do with item. I’ve found that the % Amazon lowers is all over the place on different items, some high, some low. On this coat the regular price was $68 bucks and I got it for $44 so I saves me some good samoleons.  Ok ok why am I wasting your time telling you how I save $$$$$ on this coat? If something you want has “almost new” buy it if it’s a great savings because I’ve done this a lot and never found the item has anything wrong. another example a pair of work boots that I saved 45%."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,I ordered black and got.... a very very dark navy? Or is it black? I have no idea!,3.0,"I'm rating this 3 stars, not because the jacket doesn't fit well or look good, but because I'm not sure if I got the right color!Let me start off with the good: This jacket is AWESOME! The feeling of it on is very comfortable and is a perfect fit for my body (Broad shoulders @ 6'0"" 170lbs) and looks absolutely amazing. I've never had a jacket that I felt looked this good. Genuinely! The interior lining is comfy, the pocket is quite deep, the hood can easily be removed, and can easily be worn on the daily!Now the bad (I won't be mentioning the color issue here since that's not a fault of the jacket itself): My levis logo on my chest pocket seems to have gotten hit by a bit of dye during manufacturing and comes off as low quality when you look at it (pictured). I'm sure this could easily be fixed so I'm honestly not too annoyed with this. The armpit area is actually quite tight. Personally, I've always had this issue with medium-sized jackets so I honestly don't blame the jacket for this, it's simply my body type. Something to know if you're thinking of buying this, though. Overall, these issues really don't bother me and wouldn't stop me from ever buying this jacket again!The reason I've subtracted 2 stars: The label on the interior of the jacket does indeed say ""NVY"" in its color ID. However, the label on the bag says black. DOUBLE HOWEVER, upon close examination of the sticker that's underneath the other inventory stickers, it states that this jacket is originally a navy jacket (pictured)! Although... everyone I've asked has said the jacket looks black to them but does have a bit of blue in there. I'm honestly not 100% sure this is black or not. To me, it looks very black but does have a smidge of blue in it and could possibly pass as a navy jacket, perhaps in broad daylight. This might be difficult to see in the pictures so I guess you'll just have to take my word for it.As of right now (9/8/2020) I've contacted Amazon support (Amazon was the seller in this scenario) and have arranged for a replacement which should be here in a few days. If the replacement is a genuine black label and it still looks the same, I'll tally this up to an error in the factory and be done with it. I'll be sure to post a few pictures of it on myself as well so people can get an idea of what it looks like on my body type!"
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Great Jacket **two things to note,4.0,"I love this jacket (with two small caveats), but overall it is great!I am 5' 11"" at 165 lbs and the medium was a very good fit. I would say that anyone more than a couple inches taller than me should probably get a large because of the length.Bottom line is I would definitely recommend this jacket if you are ok with two minor things to be aware of (see below).Pros:~The jacket is very warm, with fleece-lined pockets (which is nice for cold hands) and it stands up to wind very well~Very good build quality - all seems feel very good and I don't see any messy stiching~Good, metal zippers and cord stops~Good fit for someone with an athletic to moderate frame (I usually find jackets too large in the stomach and too small in the shoulders, but this jacket is very good)~Looks much better than a standard winter coat for wearing to school, events, etcCons:~The color in the photos is NOT the color I received (ordered khaki, but mine is much darker, almost army green) - see photo~During normal use, the inside sleeve material has a tendency to fold out past the end of the sleeves. I have tried ironing them and pulling them back into the jacket, but they always end up like this after a day of wearing. - see second photoIf these two things don't bother you then go for it!"
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Amazon selling a batch of factory defects?,1.0,"I'm now returning my 3rd jacket.When I first ordered the jacket, the buttons were installed too close to the zipper such that the zipper was snagging on the buttons. Definitely a defect, so I sent it back with no hassle through Amazon.My replacement was defective too, however. There were no buttons on the cuffs, the sleeves felt shorter, and the inside polyester material protruded, all of which looked noticeably ""off"" to people who hadn't even seen the proper construction of the jacket. Also, the two pockets over the top of the buttoned pockets on the front of the jacket were sewn shut (or non-existent). Since my first jacket had both of these things right (if not the buttons), I knew this one was defective as well. So I sent it back.The third jacket I received was the same as the second. So now I'm sending it back again.I'm thankful for Amazon's painless returns, but it really seems like they're selling the Levi's factory defects. It's incredibly frustrating to think that winter might be over before I even get a good jacket."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,"Weird fit for tall, skinnier guys.",3.0,"I'll start by saying I'm about 6'1 and 170lbs, athletic/slender. I ordered a large because I like to layer in cold weather. From the pictures of the model wearing it and the reviews, I expected this coat to be a little more form fitting, but so far it seems a little boxy. It is also a lot shorter than I expected. It sits right at my belt. If I zip it and lift my arms shoulder height, it comes up above my belt. If I lift my arms over my head, it rises above my belly button. Also seems loose in the lower back, which will allow cold air in for sure. It fits well otherwise.. chest, shoulders and arms are comfortable. There's about a $60 difference between what I paid for the large and the large-tall size, so I may end up just returning it."

Am slim/fit 5’11 & 155 pounds, pants size 30x32 & the jacket sat slightly below my waist, not wide or baggy, just snug, sleeve length seemed normal, the jacket is restrictive in the shoulder area, don’t raise your arms. I don’t ever recommend going a size up or down but, that’s just me personally. The inside of the jacket is made up of some kind of rough furry material, the roughness was kinda disappointing. The jacket overall looks good, with or without the hoodie, the hoodie is removable. The jacket is neither light or heavy."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,A pox on pizza theif.,5.0,"Good jacket. Pretty warm, you will need to layer if you're getting into temperatures under literal freezing. That's 0°C/32°F, for those who dropped out of junior high. It definitely retains heat when zipped up. I wouldn't wear this if it's 70+. You'll get sweaty quick. Lots of pockets. Fits well, the black will show dirt pretty quick. I really liked this thing. It is made in China, for those whom it may concern. This jacket is so good, in fact, that some copulator of maternal figures had to go and swipe it while I had it in the break room at work. I bet it was the same guy that stole my pizza out of the fridge, and just left the crust in the box as if I wouldn't notice."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,SIZE UP FOR BIG SHOULDERS!!!,5.0,"It fits well, I'm normally a 2XT, but after reading the reviews, I decided on the 3XT. A bit big, but good through the shoulders. So when I layer it'll work out fine. It's just a bit big through the middle.Otherwise, a very well made and comfortable jacket. I'm going to wear it this morning, only 23° outside!!I highly recommend this jacket! But your normal size unless you have wide shoulders like me from sports my whole life!"
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Well-made mostly winter jacket,5.0,"I believe clothes shopping with my 15 yr old son to guage size, fit, and likeability in multiple stores my own personal circle of hell. There's a lot of deep breathing exercises. And in comes Amazon. This coat really impressed me when it arrived. Wasn't sure it would be warm enough. My son all of a sudden despised the Columbia type winter jackets. Wanted more, I don't know, lived in style. Think Beatnik practical. I humored him (anything to keep from going back into the hell of clothes shopping) and was really impressed. This coat is heavy. Seriously. Thick and lined. The price is great for a name brand item and the product you receive. Keeps my nightmare inducing offspring warm and we live in Idaho with stupid single digit weather for weeks. You live closer to Canada, may wanna consider a parka. This won't cut it. Oh! And for reference. He's 5'7"", lanky but really filled out because of weight training. The medium fits beautifully."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,"Great Fit, Durable Material",5.0,"I was skeptical at first about this jacket, but boy was I blown away when I got it. This jacket is the real deal. I am 6'1"" 160 lbs and the medium fits me perfectly. The body of the jacket is lined with a type of fur and the pockets are lined with fleece (perfect for my cold hands!). The  material a kind of durable cotton, super tough. The hoodie is nice and big so it fits over my head all the way (A lot of jackets I've seen have tiny hoods that don't fit). The hoodie part is removable, but I don't think I'll ever remove it. Everything about this jacket is super durable and I am very happy with it."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,GREAT COAT,5.0,"Coat was $45 because it was a return “like new”. I always buy things when that are on wish list when Amazon lowers the moolah after someone returns the item without proper packaging, labels or something that really doesn’t have anything to do with item. I’ve found that the % Amazon lowers is all over the place on different items, some high, some low. On this coat the regular price was $68 bucks and I got it for $44 so I saves me some good samoleons.  Ok ok why am I wasting your time telling you how I save $$$$$ on this coat? If something you want has “almost new” buy it if it’s a great savings because I’ve done this a lot and never found the item has anything wrong. another example a pair of work boots that I saved 45%."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,I ordered black and got.... a very very dark navy? Or is it black? I have no idea!,3.0,"I'm rating this 3 stars, not because the jacket doesn't fit well or look good, but because I'm not sure if I got the right color!Let me start off with the good: This jacket is AWESOME! The feeling of it on is very comfortable and is a perfect fit for my body (Broad shoulders @ 6'0"" 170lbs) and looks absolutely amazing. I've never had a jacket that I felt looked this good. Genuinely! The interior lining is comfy, the pocket is quite deep, the hood can easily be removed, and can easily be worn on the daily!Now the bad (I won't be mentioning the color issue here since that's not a fault of the jacket itself): My levis logo on my chest pocket seems to have gotten hit by a bit of dye during manufacturing and comes off as low quality when you look at it (pictured). I'm sure this could easily be fixed so I'm honestly not too annoyed with this. The armpit area is actually quite tight. Personally, I've always had this issue with medium-sized jackets so I honestly don't blame the jacket for this, it's simply my body type. Something to know if you're thinking of buying this, though. Overall, these issues really don't bother me and wouldn't stop me from ever buying this jacket again!The reason I've subtracted 2 stars: The label on the interior of the jacket does indeed say ""NVY"" in its color ID. However, the label on the bag says black. DOUBLE HOWEVER, upon close examination of the sticker that's underneath the other inventory stickers, it states that this jacket is originally a navy jacket (pictured)! Although... everyone I've asked has said the jacket looks black to them but does have a bit of blue in there. I'm honestly not 100% sure this is black or not. To me, it looks very black but does have a smidge of blue in it and could possibly pass as a navy jacket, perhaps in broad daylight. This might be difficult to see in the pictures so I guess you'll just have to take my word for it.As of right now (9/8/2020) I've contacted Amazon support (Amazon was the seller in this scenario) and have arranged for a replacement which should be here in a few days. If the replacement is a genuine black label and it still looks the same, I'll tally this up to an error in the factory and be done with it. I'll be sure to post a few pictures of it on myself as well so people can get an idea of what it looks like on my body type!"
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Great Jacket **two things to note,4.0,"I love this jacket (with two small caveats), but overall it is great!I am 5' 11"" at 165 lbs and the medium was a very good fit. I would say that anyone more than a couple inches taller than me should probably get a large because of the length.Bottom line is I would definitely recommend this jacket if you are ok with two minor things to be aware of (see below).Pros:~The jacket is very warm, with fleece-lined pockets (which is nice for cold hands) and it stands up to wind very well~Very good build quality - all seems feel very good and I don't see any messy stiching~Good, metal zippers and cord stops~Good fit for someone with an athletic to moderate frame (I usually find jackets too large in the stomach and too small in the shoulders, but this jacket is very good)~Looks much better than a standard winter coat for wearing to school, events, etcCons:~The color in the photos is NOT the color I received (ordered khaki, but mine is much darker, almost army green) - see photo~During normal use, the inside sleeve material has a tendency to fold out past the end of the sleeves. I have tried ironing them and pulling them back into the jacket, but they always end up like this after a day of wearing. - see second photoIf these two things don't bother you then go for it!"
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Amazon selling a batch of factory defects?,1.0,"I'm now returning my 3rd jacket.When I first ordered the jacket, the buttons were installed too close to the zipper such that the zipper was snagging on the buttons. Definitely a defect, so I sent it back with no hassle through Amazon.My replacement was defective too, however. There were no buttons on the cuffs, the sleeves felt shorter, and the inside polyester material protruded, all of which looked noticeably ""off"" to people who hadn't even seen the proper construction of the jacket. Also, the two pockets over the top of the buttoned pockets on the front of the jacket were sewn shut (or non-existent). Since my first jacket had both of these things right (if not the buttons), I knew this one was defective as well. So I sent it back.The third jacket I received was the same as the second. So now I'm sending it back again.I'm thankful for Amazon's painless returns, but it really seems like they're selling the Levi's factory defects. It's incredibly frustrating to think that winter might be over before I even get a good jacket."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,"Weird fit for tall, skinnier guys.",3.0,"I'll start by saying I'm about 6'1 and 170lbs, athletic/slender. I ordered a large because I like to layer in cold weather. From the pictures of the model wearing it and the reviews, I expected this coat to be a little more form fitting, but so far it seems a little boxy. It is also a lot shorter than I expected. It sits right at my belt. If I zip it and lift my arms shoulder height, it comes up above my belt. If I lift my arms over my head, it rises above my belly button. Also seems loose in the lower back, which will allow cold air in for sure. It fits well otherwise.. chest, shoulders and arms are comfortable. There's about a $60 difference between what I paid for the large and the large-tall size, so I may end up just returning it."

Am slim/fit 5’11 & 155 pounds, pants size 30x32 & the jacket sat slightly below my waist, not wide or baggy, just snug, sleeve length seemed normal, the jacket is restrictive in the shoulder area, don’t raise your arms. I don’t ever recommend going a size up or down but, that’s just me personally. The inside of the jacket is made up of some kind of rough furry material, the roughness was kinda disappointing. The jacket overall looks good, with or without the hoodie, the hoodie is removable. The jacket is neither light or heavy."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,A pox on pizza theif.,5.0,"Good jacket. Pretty warm, you will need to layer if you're getting into temperatures under literal freezing. That's 0°C/32°F, for those who dropped out of junior high. It definitely retains heat when zipped up. I wouldn't wear this if it's 70+. You'll get sweaty quick. Lots of pockets. Fits well, the black will show dirt pretty quick. I really liked this thing. It is made in China, for those whom it may concern. This jacket is so good, in fact, that some copulator of maternal figures had to go and swipe it while I had it in the break room at work. I bet it was the same guy that stole my pizza out of the fridge, and just left the crust in the box as if I wouldn't notice."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,SIZE UP FOR BIG SHOULDERS!!!,5.0,"It fits well, I'm normally a 2XT, but after reading the reviews, I decided on the 3XT. A bit big, but good through the shoulders. So when I layer it'll work out fine. It's just a bit big through the middle.Otherwise, a very well made and comfortable jacket. I'm going to wear it this morning, only 23° outside!!I highly recommend this jacket! But your normal size unless you have wide shoulders like me from sports my whole life!"
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Well-made mostly winter jacket,5.0,"I believe clothes shopping with my 15 yr old son to guage size, fit, and likeability in multiple stores my own personal circle of hell. There's a lot of deep breathing exercises. And in comes Amazon. This coat really impressed me when it arrived. Wasn't sure it would be warm enough. My son all of a sudden despised the Columbia type winter jackets. Wanted more, I don't know, lived in style. Think Beatnik practical. I humored him (anything to keep from going back into the hell of clothes shopping) and was really impressed. This coat is heavy. Seriously. Thick and lined. The price is great for a name brand item and the product you receive. Keeps my nightmare inducing offspring warm and we live in Idaho with stupid single digit weather for weeks. You live closer to Canada, may wanna consider a parka. This won't cut it. Oh! And for reference. He's 5'7"", lanky but really filled out because of weight training. The medium fits beautifully."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,"Great Fit, Durable Material",5.0,"I was skeptical at first about this jacket, but boy was I blown away when I got it. This jacket is the real deal. I am 6'1"" 160 lbs and the medium fits me perfectly. The body of the jacket is lined with a type of fur and the pockets are lined with fleece (perfect for my cold hands!). The  material a kind of durable cotton, super tough. The hoodie is nice and big so it fits over my head all the way (A lot of jackets I've seen have tiny hoods that don't fit). The hoodie part is removable, but I don't think I'll ever remove it. Everything about this jacket is super durable and I am very happy with it."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,GREAT COAT,5.0,"Coat was $45 because it was a return “like new”. I always buy things when that are on wish list when Amazon lowers the moolah after someone returns the item without proper packaging, labels or something that really doesn’t have anything to do with item. I’ve found that the % Amazon lowers is all over the place on different items, some high, some low. On this coat the regular price was $68 bucks and I got it for $44 so I saves me some good samoleons.  Ok ok why am I wasting your time telling you how I save $$$$$ on this coat? If something you want has “almost new” buy it if it’s a great savings because I’ve done this a lot and never found the item has anything wrong. another example a pair of work boots that I saved 45%."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,I ordered black and got.... a very very dark navy? Or is it black? I have no idea!,3.0,"I'm rating this 3 stars, not because the jacket doesn't fit well or look good, but because I'm not sure if I got the right color!Let me start off with the good: This jacket is AWESOME! The feeling of it on is very comfortable and is a perfect fit for my body (Broad shoulders @ 6'0"" 170lbs) and looks absolutely amazing. I've never had a jacket that I felt looked this good. Genuinely! The interior lining is comfy, the pocket is quite deep, the hood can easily be removed, and can easily be worn on the daily!Now the bad (I won't be mentioning the color issue here since that's not a fault of the jacket itself): My levis logo on my chest pocket seems to have gotten hit by a bit of dye during manufacturing and comes off as low quality when you look at it (pictured). I'm sure this could easily be fixed so I'm honestly not too annoyed with this. The armpit area is actually quite tight. Personally, I've always had this issue with medium-sized jackets so I honestly don't blame the jacket for this, it's simply my body type. Something to know if you're thinking of buying this, though. Overall, these issues really don't bother me and wouldn't stop me from ever buying this jacket again!The reason I've subtracted 2 stars: The label on the interior of the jacket does indeed say ""NVY"" in its color ID. However, the label on the bag says black. DOUBLE HOWEVER, upon close examination of the sticker that's underneath the other inventory stickers, it states that this jacket is originally a navy jacket (pictured)! Although... everyone I've asked has said the jacket looks black to them but does have a bit of blue in there. I'm honestly not 100% sure this is black or not. To me, it looks very black but does have a smidge of blue in it and could possibly pass as a navy jacket, perhaps in broad daylight. This might be difficult to see in the pictures so I guess you'll just have to take my word for it.As of right now (9/8/2020) I've contacted Amazon support (Amazon was the seller in this scenario) and have arranged for a replacement which should be here in a few days. If the replacement is a genuine black label and it still looks the same, I'll tally this up to an error in the factory and be done with it. I'll be sure to post a few pictures of it on myself as well so people can get an idea of what it looks like on my body type!"
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Great Jacket **two things to note,4.0,"I love this jacket (with two small caveats), but overall it is great!I am 5' 11"" at 165 lbs and the medium was a very good fit. I would say that anyone more than a couple inches taller than me should probably get a large because of the length.Bottom line is I would definitely recommend this jacket if you are ok with two minor things to be aware of (see below).Pros:~The jacket is very warm, with fleece-lined pockets (which is nice for cold hands) and it stands up to wind very well~Very good build quality - all seems feel very good and I don't see any messy stiching~Good, metal zippers and cord stops~Good fit for someone with an athletic to moderate frame (I usually find jackets too large in the stomach and too small in the shoulders, but this jacket is very good)~Looks much better than a standard winter coat for wearing to school, events, etcCons:~The color in the photos is NOT the color I received (ordered khaki, but mine is much darker, almost army green) - see photo~During normal use, the inside sleeve material has a tendency to fold out past the end of the sleeves. I have tried ironing them and pulling them back into the jacket, but they always end up like this after a day of wearing. - see second photoIf these two things don't bother you then go for it!"
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,Amazon selling a batch of factory defects?,1.0,"I'm now returning my 3rd jacket.When I first ordered the jacket, the buttons were installed too close to the zipper such that the zipper was snagging on the buttons. Definitely a defect, so I sent it back with no hassle through Amazon.My replacement was defective too, however. There were no buttons on the cuffs, the sleeves felt shorter, and the inside polyester material protruded, all of which looked noticeably ""off"" to people who hadn't even seen the proper construction of the jacket. Also, the two pockets over the top of the buttoned pockets on the front of the jacket were sewn shut (or non-existent). Since my first jacket had both of these things right (if not the buttons), I knew this one was defective as well. So I sent it back.The third jacket I received was the same as the second. So now I'm sending it back again.I'm thankful for Amazon's painless returns, but it really seems like they're selling the Levi's factory defects. It's incredibly frustrating to think that winter might be over before I even get a good jacket."
Levi's Men's Washed Cotton Hooded Military Jacket,"Weird fit for tall, skinnier guys.",3.0,"I'll start by saying I'm about 6'1 and 170lbs, athletic/slender. I ordered a large because I like to layer in cold weather. From the pictures of the model wearing it and the reviews, I expected this coat to be a little more form fitting, but so far it seems a little boxy. It is also a lot shorter than I expected. It sits right at my belt. If I zip it and lift my arms shoulder height, it comes up above my belt. If I lift my arms over my head, it rises above my belly button. Also seems loose in the lower back, which will allow cold air in for sure. It fits well otherwise.. chest, shoulders and arms are comfortable. There's about a $60 difference between what I paid for the large and the large-tall size, so I may end up just returning it."

This jacket just looks good and has a lot of well thought out details. Stuff it in a pack and go on a hike. Zip it up to walk the dog in a downpour. Layer under it and take it on on a snowy commute. It can do all that and like all Marmot gear it does everything in style.
MARMOT mens Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,"Good looking jacket, bought for the Goretex!",4.0,"I bought this jacket because of its Goretex fabric.  Have not used it yet in the rain, but I purchased a large to be able to use this jacket as a winter shell, and wear a thin down sweater underneath this jacket.  Fit is perfect for that.  As a comparison, I have a Marmot Knife Edge jacket in Medium, and that fits great, with just a long sleeve t-shirt underneath.  I could not wear anything thicker with the Medium.For the price, this jacket is a good value(I paid around $100 for warehouse like new)"
MARMOT mens Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,A really great jacket.,5.0,"This to me is the perfect outer layer. I’ve worn it in the winter’s snowy cold and wind. I wear an Xl. It fits just right. I wear a base layer, shirt and down vest. It keeps me warm and dry. It keeps the rain out. The zipper never jams. The hood fits nicely. The simple Velcro straps on the wrists are easy to use, even while wearing gloves. This jacket is very light and quite packable.  I highly recommend it."
MARMOT mens Minimalist Lightweight Waterproof Rain Jacket,cut is a little slim around the belly,4.0,"This is a very nice jacket. Breathable and waterproof. The fabric feels premium.The cut is large in the shoulders yet a bit trim around the midsection.  The Marmot Precip has more of a generous cut around the middle.  I was expecting similar tailoring from this jacket, but not so.It's a really nice jacket, but if you've got some extra padding around your midsection, it's a little snug.Also the breast pocket is on the right side, not the best solution if you are right-handed."

Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"The listing is a lie, this jacket is only partially cotton lined.",1.0,"I got this jacket because I wanted a warm flannel lined jacket and I was sick of my current polyester lined jacket.This jacket was listed as 100% cotton lined for both sleeves and body. As you can see from my pictures, that was a lie.Which is too bad, I liked it otherwise.1 star for your lies."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",4.0,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,You don't get what you pay for.,1.0,Jacket looks good. But is really cheaply made. Has zero warmth. No lining in the sleeves at all. And the lining in the rest is minimal at best. The snaps are a joke. They pop open with the slightest movement. The stitching was coming out down the front. And the top pocket and the inside pocket are small small your phone won't fit. Your buying the name and the hype when you buy this overpriced jacket. Looks good but has too many issues to recommend.
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"Not Really ""Rugged"" But Has Grown On Me",4.0,"I'm the kind of guy who usually gets my clothes from Goodwill or Walmart, so $80 was a big spend from me and I had pretty high expectations. I was really looking to replace a shirt/jacket I had that was very tough & rugged and that I wore outdoors all the time - a sort of heavy denim-type material (that looked nicer).This jacket isn't that. What LW calls the ""Weathered Cotton"" isn't that tough at all, though it kind of looks like it would be. In fact, it's kind of smooth, almost velvety but in a pleasant way. I don't know if their marketing phrase ""cotton suede"" is precisely accurate but it's sort of a good description.So I was initially pretty disappointed - I spent what, for me, was a lot of money and I didn't get the outdoors shirt that I could just walk through a bunch of brambles on a deer hunt, or throw under my backside to sit on a rocky beach while fishing, or whatever. But as time has passed, I've noticed that it is a great shirt/jacket for fall weather around town, and despite the rugged-ish look it's reasonably stylish. If you're taking the dog for a walk and then swinging by the bank afterwards, it's perfect. I end up wearing it a lot more than I thought I would, so that has made me come back and sort of reluctantly give it 4 stars.The sizing was fine, for me. The sleeves are longer than most shirts which is a huge plus for me at 6'5"". If you're on the shorter side of average that may be an issue. It's not super-warm, the sleeves are unlined, but if you're looking for a shirt/jacket that's more shirt than jacket, this is probably what you're after.TL/DR - this shirt isn't ""rugged"" or a better-looking version of Carhartt or whatever. But it is a pretty nice shirt and I've come to really like it and I wear the thing all the time now."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Money well spent,5.0,"I just received my jacket today. I read through the reviews and reviews on other websites. I'm a simple man and dropping this much cash on one article of clothing is way outside my comfort zone, especially buying online where I cant touch it and feel the quality and fit. After opening the package and trying it on I feel that my money was well spent. Its exactly what I was looking for.I ordered my regular size (XL) and it fits just as a jacket should. It's not billowing out anywhere but it's big enough that I don't feel constricted anywhere. I tried it on with a thin t shirt but a heavier shirt would be fine under it as well. I am 6ft tall and 230 lbs with a bit of a belly if that helps anyone with sizing. I also have a hard time with shirts and coats sometimes feeling a little too short. This jacket was perfect. It hangs past my waist, even with arms raised but it's not so long that it looks sloppy either.Some people complained about the pockets not being big enough or pockets being in an awkward position. I don't see that at all. My phone fit comfortably in the pocket and I wouldn't worry about it falling out. Keys fit as well. Not sure what else I'd need to put in a pocket that would be a deal breaker. I guess we all have different needs. The position of the pocket was pretty comfortable too. They are a little farther back than normal but not much at all.The jacket was pleasantly heavier than I expected. It feels pretty close to a well broken in denim jacket in weight and in texture on the outside. All the buttons look good and function as they should. The liner is nice. The inner sleeves are slick and not the flannel that is used in the cuffs and the torso area. I like that because it helps to not bunch up long sleeves when putting the jacket on.All and all this is a fantastic jacket for cool weather. It's very stylish yet very functional as well. I would not hesitate to buy this again."

Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"Not Really ""Rugged"" But Has Grown On Me",4.0,"I'm the kind of guy who usually gets my clothes from Goodwill or Walmart, so $80 was a big spend from me and I had pretty high expectations. I was really looking to replace a shirt/jacket I had that was very tough & rugged and that I wore outdoors all the time - a sort of heavy denim-type material (that looked nicer).This jacket isn't that. What LW calls the ""Weathered Cotton"" isn't that tough at all, though it kind of looks like it would be. In fact, it's kind of smooth, almost velvety but in a pleasant way. I don't know if their marketing phrase ""cotton suede"" is precisely accurate but it's sort of a good description.So I was initially pretty disappointed - I spent what, for me, was a lot of money and I didn't get the outdoors shirt that I could just walk through a bunch of brambles on a deer hunt, or throw under my backside to sit on a rocky beach while fishing, or whatever. But as time has passed, I've noticed that it is a great shirt/jacket for fall weather around town, and despite the rugged-ish look it's reasonably stylish. If you're taking the dog for a walk and then swinging by the bank afterwards, it's perfect. I end up wearing it a lot more than I thought I would, so that has made me come back and sort of reluctantly give it 4 stars.The sizing was fine, for me. The sleeves are longer than most shirts which is a huge plus for me at 6'5"". If you're on the shorter side of average that may be an issue. It's not super-warm, the sleeves are unlined, but if you're looking for a shirt/jacket that's more shirt than jacket, this is probably what you're after.TL/DR - this shirt isn't ""rugged"" or a better-looking version of Carhartt or whatever. But it is a pretty nice shirt and I've come to really like it and I wear the thing all the time now."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Money well spent,5.0,"I just received my jacket today. I read through the reviews and reviews on other websites. I'm a simple man and dropping this much cash on one article of clothing is way outside my comfort zone, especially buying online where I cant touch it and feel the quality and fit. After opening the package and trying it on I feel that my money was well spent. Its exactly what I was looking for.I ordered my regular size (XL) and it fits just as a jacket should. It's not billowing out anywhere but it's big enough that I don't feel constricted anywhere. I tried it on with a thin t shirt but a heavier shirt would be fine under it as well. I am 6ft tall and 230 lbs with a bit of a belly if that helps anyone with sizing. I also have a hard time with shirts and coats sometimes feeling a little too short. This jacket was perfect. It hangs past my waist, even with arms raised but it's not so long that it looks sloppy either.Some people complained about the pockets not being big enough or pockets being in an awkward position. I don't see that at all. My phone fit comfortably in the pocket and I wouldn't worry about it falling out. Keys fit as well. Not sure what else I'd need to put in a pocket that would be a deal breaker. I guess we all have different needs. The position of the pocket was pretty comfortable too. They are a little farther back than normal but not much at all.The jacket was pleasantly heavier than I expected. It feels pretty close to a well broken in denim jacket in weight and in texture on the outside. All the buttons look good and function as they should. The liner is nice. The inner sleeves are slick and not the flannel that is used in the cuffs and the torso area. I like that because it helps to not bunch up long sleeves when putting the jacket on.All and all this is a fantastic jacket for cool weather. It's very stylish yet very functional as well. I would not hesitate to buy this again."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"The listing is a lie, this jacket is only partially cotton lined.",1.0,"I got this jacket because I wanted a warm flannel lined jacket and I was sick of my current polyester lined jacket.This jacket was listed as 100% cotton lined for both sleeves and body. As you can see from my pictures, that was a lie.Which is too bad, I liked it otherwise.1 star for your lies."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",4.0,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

After opening the package and trying it on I feel that my money was well spent. Its exactly what I was looking for.I ordered my regular size (XL) and it fits just as a jacket should. It's not billowing out anywhere but it's big enough that I don't feel constricted anywhere. I tried it on with a thin t shirt but a heavier shirt would be fine under it as well. I am 6ft tall and 230 lbs with a bit of a belly if that helps anyone with sizing. I also have a hard time with shirts and coats sometimes feeling a little too short. This jacket was perfect. It hangs past my waist, even with arms raised but it's not so long that it looks sloppy either.Some people complained about the pockets not being big enough or pockets being in an awkward position. I don't see that at all. My phone fit comfortably in the pocket and I wouldn't worry about it falling out. Keys fit as well. Not sure what else I'd need to put in a pocket that would be a deal breaker. I guess we all have different needs. The position of the pocket was pretty comfortable too. They are a little farther back than normal but not much at all.The jacket was pleasantly heavier than I expected. It feels pretty close to a well broken in denim jacket in weight and in texture on the outside. All the buttons look good and function as they should. The liner is nice. The inner sleeves are slick and not the flannel that is used in the cuffs and the torso area. I like that because it helps to not bunch up long sleeves when putting the jacket on.All and all this is a fantastic jacket for cool weather. It's very stylish yet very functional as well. I would not hesitate to buy this again."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"The listing is a lie, this jacket is only partially cotton lined.",1.0,"I got this jacket because I wanted a warm flannel lined jacket and I was sick of my current polyester lined jacket.This jacket was listed as 100% cotton lined for both sleeves and body. As you can see from my pictures, that was a lie.Which is too bad, I liked it otherwise.1 star for your lies."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",4.0,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Ron Swanson,4.0,"Not a heavy jacket. Good as an outter shell. Currently in use as a 'Shop Jacket'. I've had complements regarding its style.

Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,READ REVIEWS...STAY AWAY FROM THIS CRAP!,1.0,"I should have read more reviews. The jacket STINKS horribly; by that I mean that it smells/reeks of chemicals, enough to give you a headache!  I have never experienced something like this. It’s a cheap, made in China, POS!  DO NOT WASTE YOUR $$$!!  It fits all kinds of wrong!  It’s huge...long arms...It’s not completely lined. The pictures make it seem that the sleeves are fleece lined; they are not!  On top of everything, I have to pay $7.00 to return!  I spend thousands on Amazon and this is how I’m treated. Ridiculous!  Shame on me for not reading reviews. Live & learn."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Stitching is weak!,1.0,"This is a warm, good looking shirt jacket.But don’t let the looks fool you!I almost paid to have my logo sewn into it.The stitching is double on the sleeve cuffs, pockets & button placards. But in the places where it receives the most stress it is single stitched from the inside. This allows the armpits to blow out & reveal the crappy construction behind the material. Then the seams by the pockets comes apart. Then the Velcro rips apart the inside pocket.$70 is a lot to pay for a good shirt if it is going to fall apart so quickly!It’s not going to be an easy fix & im pissed off!Can’t bring myself to buy a replacement at these prices with cheap stitching!Wish there was a brand made with quality stitching that had this look & feel!I have been impressed with your brand & have bought many flannel shirts & Henleys.Very surprised you would put such crappy workmanship into a product you sell to be a jacket or outerwear. Which should be more durable than a regular shirt."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Awesome jacket!,5.0,"I find it hard to find women's jackets that come in the same earthy tones as alot of men's wear, so I ordered this in the small.  Awesome jacket!! Other than the sleeves being obviously huge which I had anticipated, it is a great fit and quality. Perfect insulation, and definitely a great light fall work coat.  Tops!"
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"Much to the dismay of my wife, I hate this jacket...",1.0,"This may be great for a someone who wants to pretend that they are rugged, but if you are looking for a functional jacket, it totally misses the mark.CONS:1) Thin and lightweight, so it doesn't provide much warmth.2) The flannel lining is nice but thin. Definitely not traditional flannel material.3) Sleeves are not lined with the flannel material, only a silk-like lining (definite sign that this is made for looks, not work.)4) My biggest gripe is the side hand pockets... who in the world thought this position was a good idea? (3 and 9 o'clock positions). You need to reach BEHIND yourself to get your hands into the pockets! Either Legendary Whitetails didn't plan on users using these pockets or they didn't test it before production with real people. Since the pockets are sewn right into the 3-9 seams, I believe they were just lazy.PROS:1) Nice color2) Outer material has seems well-made3) Buttons are awesome4) Chest and internal pockets are greatFINAL THOUGHTS: The side hand pocket issues are a non-negotiable for me. It would never be remotely close to my favorite jacket even with this fixed. If you only want this for a light layer to go out in the evening and have no use for side pockets, then this is the jacket for you! If you are looking at this for use in the shop, the cold, hiking, or tactical, look elsewhere."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,You don't get what you pay for.,1.0,Jacket looks good. But is really cheaply made. Has zero warmth. No lining in the sleeves at all. And the lining in the rest is minimal at best. The snaps are a joke. They pop open with the slightest movement. The stitching was coming out down the front. And the top pocket and the inside pocket are small small your phone won't fit. Your buying the name and the hype when you buy this overpriced jacket. Looks good but has too many issues to recommend.
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"Not Really ""Rugged"" But Has Grown On Me",4.0,"I'm the kind of guy who usually gets my clothes from Goodwill or Walmart, so $80 was a big spend from me and I had pretty high expectations. I was really looking to replace a shirt/jacket I had that was very tough & rugged and that I wore outdoors all the time - a sort of heavy denim-type material (that looked nicer).This jacket isn't that. What LW calls the ""Weathered Cotton"" isn't that tough at all, though it kind of looks like it would be. In fact, it's kind of smooth, almost velvety but in a pleasant way. I don't know if their marketing phrase ""cotton suede"" is precisely accurate but it's sort of a good description.So I was initially pretty disappointed - I spent what, for me, was a lot of money and I didn't get the outdoors shirt that I could just walk through a bunch of brambles on a deer hunt, or throw under my backside to sit on a rocky beach while fishing, or whatever. But as time has passed, I've noticed that it is a great shirt/jacket for fall weather around town, and despite the rugged-ish look it's reasonably stylish. If you're taking the dog for a walk and then swinging by the bank afterwards, it's perfect. I end up wearing it a lot more than I thought I would, so that has made me come back and sort of reluctantly give it 4 stars.The sizing was fine, for me. The sleeves are longer than most shirts which is a huge plus for me at 6'5"". If you're on the shorter side of average that may be an issue. It's not super-warm, the sleeves are unlined, but if you're looking for a shirt/jacket that's more shirt than jacket, this is probably what you're after.TL/DR - this shirt isn't ""rugged"" or a better-looking version of Carhartt or whatever. But it is a pretty nice shirt and I've come to really like it and I wear the thing all the time now."

However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Ron Swanson,4.0,"Not a heavy jacket. Good as an outter shell. Currently in use as a 'Shop Jacket'. I've had complements regarding its style.

The jacket STINKS horribly; by that I mean that it smells/reeks of chemicals, enough to give you a headache!  I have never experienced something like this. It’s a cheap, made in China, POS!  DO NOT WASTE YOUR $$$!!  It fits all kinds of wrong!  It’s huge...long arms...It’s not completely lined. The pictures make it seem that the sleeves are fleece lined; they are not!  On top of everything, I have to pay $7.00 to return!  I spend thousands on Amazon and this is how I’m treated. Ridiculous!  Shame on me for not reading reviews. Live & learn."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Stitching is weak!,1.0,"This is a warm, good looking shirt jacket.But don’t let the looks fool you!I almost paid to have my logo sewn into it.The stitching is double on the sleeve cuffs, pockets & button placards. But in the places where it receives the most stress it is single stitched from the inside. This allows the armpits to blow out & reveal the crappy construction behind the material. Then the seams by the pockets comes apart. Then the Velcro rips apart the inside pocket.$70 is a lot to pay for a good shirt if it is going to fall apart so quickly!It’s not going to be an easy fix & im pissed off!Can’t bring myself to buy a replacement at these prices with cheap stitching!Wish there was a brand made with quality stitching that had this look & feel!I have been impressed with your brand & have bought many flannel shirts & Henleys.Very surprised you would put such crappy workmanship into a product you sell to be a jacket or outerwear. Which should be more durable than a regular shirt."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Awesome jacket!,5.0,"I find it hard to find women's jackets that come in the same earthy tones as alot of men's wear, so I ordered this in the small.  Awesome jacket!! Other than the sleeves being obviously huge which I had anticipated, it is a great fit and quality. Perfect insulation, and definitely a great light fall work coat.  Tops!"
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"Much to the dismay of my wife, I hate this jacket...",1.0,"This may be great for a someone who wants to pretend that they are rugged, but if you are looking for a functional jacket, it totally misses the mark.CONS:1) Thin and lightweight, so it doesn't provide much warmth.2) The flannel lining is nice but thin. Definitely not traditional flannel material.3) Sleeves are not lined with the flannel material, only a silk-like lining (definite sign that this is made for looks, not work.)4) My biggest gripe is the side hand pockets... who in the world thought this position was a good idea? (3 and 9 o'clock positions). You need to reach BEHIND yourself to get your hands into the pockets! Either Legendary Whitetails didn't plan on users using these pockets or they didn't test it before production with real people. Since the pockets are sewn right into the 3-9 seams, I believe they were just lazy.PROS:1) Nice color2) Outer material has seems well-made3) Buttons are awesome4) Chest and internal pockets are greatFINAL THOUGHTS: The side hand pocket issues are a non-negotiable for me. It would never be remotely close to my favorite jacket even with this fixed. If you only want this for a light layer to go out in the evening and have no use for side pockets, then this is the jacket for you! If you are looking at this for use in the shop, the cold, hiking, or tactical, look elsewhere."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,You don't get what you pay for.,1.0,Jacket looks good. But is really cheaply made. Has zero warmth. No lining in the sleeves at all. And the lining in the rest is minimal at best. The snaps are a joke. They pop open with the slightest movement. The stitching was coming out down the front. And the top pocket and the inside pocket are small small your phone won't fit. Your buying the name and the hype when you buy this overpriced jacket. Looks good but has too many issues to recommend.
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"Not Really ""Rugged"" But Has Grown On Me",4.0,"I'm the kind of guy who usually gets my clothes from Goodwill or Walmart, so $80 was a big spend from me and I had pretty high expectations. I was really looking to replace a shirt/jacket I had that was very tough & rugged and that I wore outdoors all the time - a sort of heavy denim-type material (that looked nicer).This jacket isn't that. What LW calls the ""Weathered Cotton"" isn't that tough at all, though it kind of looks like it would be. In fact, it's kind of smooth, almost velvety but in a pleasant way. I don't know if their marketing phrase ""cotton suede"" is precisely accurate but it's sort of a good description.So I was initially pretty disappointed - I spent what, for me, was a lot of money and I didn't get the outdoors shirt that I could just walk through a bunch of brambles on a deer hunt, or throw under my backside to sit on a rocky beach while fishing, or whatever. But as time has passed, I've noticed that it is a great shirt/jacket for fall weather around town, and despite the rugged-ish look it's reasonably stylish. If you're taking the dog for a walk and then swinging by the bank afterwards, it's perfect. I end up wearing it a lot more than I thought I would, so that has made me come back and sort of reluctantly give it 4 stars.The sizing was fine, for me. The sleeves are longer than most shirts which is a huge plus for me at 6'5"". If you're on the shorter side of average that may be an issue. It's not super-warm, the sleeves are unlined, but if you're looking for a shirt/jacket that's more shirt than jacket, this is probably what you're after.TL/DR - this shirt isn't ""rugged"" or a better-looking version of Carhartt or whatever. But it is a pretty nice shirt and I've come to really like it and I wear the thing all the time now."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Money well spent,5.0,"I just received my jacket today. I read through the reviews and reviews on other websites. I'm a simple man and dropping this much cash on one article of clothing is way outside my comfort zone, especially buying online where I cant touch it and feel the quality and fit. After opening the package and trying it on I feel that my money was well spent. Its exactly what I was looking for.I ordered my regular size (XL) and it fits just as a jacket should. It's not billowing out anywhere but it's big enough that I don't feel constricted anywhere. I tried it on with a thin t shirt but a heavier shirt would be fine under it as well. I am 6ft tall and 230 lbs with a bit of a belly if that helps anyone with sizing. I also have a hard time with shirts and coats sometimes feeling a little too short. This jacket was perfect. It hangs past my waist, even with arms raised but it's not so long that it looks sloppy either.Some people complained about the pockets not being big enough or pockets being in an awkward position. I don't see that at all. My phone fit comfortably in the pocket and I wouldn't worry about it falling out. Keys fit as well. Not sure what else I'd need to put in a pocket that would be a deal breaker. I guess we all have different needs. The position of the pocket was pretty comfortable too. They are a little farther back than normal but not much at all.The jacket was pleasantly heavier than I expected. It feels pretty close to a well broken in denim jacket in weight and in texture on the outside. All the buttons look good and function as they should. The liner is nice. The inner sleeves are slick and not the flannel that is used in the cuffs and the torso area. I like that because it helps to not bunch up long sleeves when putting the jacket on.All and all this is a fantastic jacket for cool weather. It's very stylish yet very functional as well. I would not hesitate to buy this again."

The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

On top of everything, I have to pay $7.00 to return!  I spend thousands on Amazon and this is how I’m treated. Ridiculous!  Shame on me for not reading reviews. Live & learn."

Then the seams by the pockets comes apart. Then the Velcro rips apart the inside pocket.$70 is a lot to pay for a good shirt if it is going to fall apart so quickly!It’s not going to be an easy fix & im pissed off!Can’t bring myself to buy a replacement at these prices with cheap stitching!Wish there was a brand made with quality stitching that had this look & feel!I have been impressed with your brand & have bought many flannel shirts & Henleys.Very surprised you would put such crappy workmanship into a product you sell to be a jacket or outerwear. Which should be more durable than a regular shirt."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Awesome jacket!,5.0,"I find it hard to find women's jackets that come in the same earthy tones as alot of men's wear, so I ordered this in the small.  Awesome jacket!! Other than the sleeves being obviously huge which I had anticipated, it is a great fit and quality. Perfect insulation, and definitely a great light fall work coat.  Tops!"

(3 and 9 o'clock positions). You need to reach BEHIND yourself to get your hands into the pockets! Either Legendary Whitetails didn't plan on users using these pockets or they didn't test it before production with real people.

It would never be remotely close to my favorite jacket even with this fixed. If you only want this for a light layer to go out in the evening and have no use for side pockets, then this is the jacket for you!

Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,You don't get what you pay for.,1.0,Jacket looks good. But is really cheaply made. Has zero warmth. No lining in the sleeves at all. And the lining in the rest is minimal at best. The snaps are a joke. They pop open with the slightest movement. The stitching was coming out down the front. And the top pocket and the inside pocket are small small your phone won't fit. Your buying the name and the hype when you buy this overpriced jacket. Looks good but has too many issues to recommend.
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"Not Really ""Rugged"" But Has Grown On Me",4.0,"I'm the kind of guy who usually gets my clothes from Goodwill or Walmart, so $80 was a big spend from me and I had pretty high expectations. I was really looking to replace a shirt/jacket I had that was very tough & rugged and that I wore outdoors all the time - a sort of heavy denim-type material (that looked nicer).This jacket isn't that. What LW calls the ""Weathered Cotton"" isn't that tough at all, though it kind of looks like it would be. In fact, it's kind of smooth, almost velvety but in a pleasant way. I don't know if their marketing phrase ""cotton suede"" is precisely accurate but it's sort of a good description.So I was initially pretty disappointed - I spent what, for me, was a lot of money and I didn't get the outdoors shirt that I could just walk through a bunch of brambles on a deer hunt, or throw under my backside to sit on a rocky beach while fishing, or whatever. But as time has passed, I've noticed that it is a great shirt/jacket for fall weather around town, and despite the rugged-ish look it's reasonably stylish. If you're taking the dog for a walk and then swinging by the bank afterwards, it's perfect. I end up wearing it a lot more than I thought I would, so that has made me come back and sort of reluctantly give it 4 stars.The sizing was fine, for me. The sleeves are longer than most shirts which is a huge plus for me at 6'5"". If you're on the shorter side of average that may be an issue. It's not super-warm, the sleeves are unlined, but if you're looking for a shirt/jacket that's more shirt than jacket, this is probably what you're after.TL/DR - this shirt isn't ""rugged"" or a better-looking version of Carhartt or whatever. But it is a pretty nice shirt and I've come to really like it and I wear the thing all the time now."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Money well spent,5.0,"I just received my jacket today. I read through the reviews and reviews on other websites. I'm a simple man and dropping this much cash on one article of clothing is way outside my comfort zone, especially buying online where I cant touch it and feel the quality and fit. After opening the package and trying it on I feel that my money was well spent. Its exactly what I was looking for.I ordered my regular size (XL) and it fits just as a jacket should. It's not billowing out anywhere but it's big enough that I don't feel constricted anywhere. I tried it on with a thin t shirt but a heavier shirt would be fine under it as well. I am 6ft tall and 230 lbs with a bit of a belly if that helps anyone with sizing. I also have a hard time with shirts and coats sometimes feeling a little too short. This jacket was perfect. It hangs past my waist, even with arms raised but it's not so long that it looks sloppy either.Some people complained about the pockets not being big enough or pockets being in an awkward position. I don't see that at all. My phone fit comfortably in the pocket and I wouldn't worry about it falling out. Keys fit as well. Not sure what else I'd need to put in a pocket that would be a deal breaker. I guess we all have different needs. The position of the pocket was pretty comfortable too. They are a little farther back than normal but not much at all.The jacket was pleasantly heavier than I expected. It feels pretty close to a well broken in denim jacket in weight and in texture on the outside. All the buttons look good and function as they should. The liner is nice. The inner sleeves are slick and not the flannel that is used in the cuffs and the torso area. I like that because it helps to not bunch up long sleeves when putting the jacket on.All and all this is a fantastic jacket for cool weather. It's very stylish yet very functional as well. I would not hesitate to buy this again."

Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",4.0,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.

Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.

It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,You don't get what you pay for.,1.0,Jacket looks good. But is really cheaply made. Has zero warmth. No lining in the sleeves at all. And the lining in the rest is minimal at best. The snaps are a joke. They pop open with the slightest movement. The stitching was coming out down the front. And the top pocket and the inside pocket are small small your phone won't fit. Your buying the name and the hype when you buy this overpriced jacket. Looks good but has too many issues to recommend.
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"Not Really ""Rugged"" But Has Grown On Me",4.0,"I'm the kind of guy who usually gets my clothes from Goodwill or Walmart, so $80 was a big spend from me and I had pretty high expectations. I was really looking to replace a shirt/jacket I had that was very tough & rugged and that I wore outdoors all the time - a sort of heavy denim-type material (that looked nicer).This jacket isn't that. What LW calls the ""Weathered Cotton"" isn't that tough at all, though it kind of looks like it would be. In fact, it's kind of smooth, almost velvety but in a pleasant way. I don't know if their marketing phrase ""cotton suede"" is precisely accurate but it's sort of a good description.So I was initially pretty disappointed - I spent what, for me, was a lot of money and I didn't get the outdoors shirt that I could just walk through a bunch of brambles on a deer hunt, or throw under my backside to sit on a rocky beach while fishing, or whatever. But as time has passed, I've noticed that it is a great shirt/jacket for fall weather around town, and despite the rugged-ish look it's reasonably stylish. If you're taking the dog for a walk and then swinging by the bank afterwards, it's perfect. I end up wearing it a lot more than I thought I would, so that has made me come back and sort of reluctantly give it 4 stars.The sizing was fine, for me. The sleeves are longer than most shirts which is a huge plus for me at 6'5"". If you're on the shorter side of average that may be an issue. It's not super-warm, the sleeves are unlined, but if you're looking for a shirt/jacket that's more shirt than jacket, this is probably what you're after.TL/DR - this shirt isn't ""rugged"" or a better-looking version of Carhartt or whatever. But it is a pretty nice shirt and I've come to really like it and I wear the thing all the time now."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Money well spent,5.0,"I just received my jacket today. I read through the reviews and reviews on other websites. I'm a simple man and dropping this much cash on one article of clothing is way outside my comfort zone, especially buying online where I cant touch it and feel the quality and fit. After opening the package and trying it on I feel that my money was well spent. Its exactly what I was looking for.I ordered my regular size (XL) and it fits just as a jacket should. It's not billowing out anywhere but it's big enough that I don't feel constricted anywhere. I tried it on with a thin t shirt but a heavier shirt would be fine under it as well. I am 6ft tall and 230 lbs with a bit of a belly if that helps anyone with sizing. I also have a hard time with shirts and coats sometimes feeling a little too short. This jacket was perfect. It hangs past my waist, even with arms raised but it's not so long that it looks sloppy either.Some people complained about the pockets not being big enough or pockets being in an awkward position. I don't see that at all. My phone fit comfortably in the pocket and I wouldn't worry about it falling out. Keys fit as well. Not sure what else I'd need to put in a pocket that would be a deal breaker. I guess we all have different needs. The position of the pocket was pretty comfortable too. They are a little farther back than normal but not much at all.The jacket was pleasantly heavier than I expected. It feels pretty close to a well broken in denim jacket in weight and in texture on the outside. All the buttons look good and function as they should. The liner is nice. The inner sleeves are slick and not the flannel that is used in the cuffs and the torso area. I like that because it helps to not bunch up long sleeves when putting the jacket on.All and all this is a fantastic jacket for cool weather. It's very stylish yet very functional as well. I would not hesitate to buy this again."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"The listing is a lie, this jacket is only partially cotton lined.",1.0,"I got this jacket because I wanted a warm flannel lined jacket and I was sick of my current polyester lined jacket.This jacket was listed as 100% cotton lined for both sleeves and body. As you can see from my pictures, that was a lie.Which is too bad, I liked it otherwise.1 star for your lies."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",4.0,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.

Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,You don't get what you pay for.,1.0,Jacket looks good. But is really cheaply made. Has zero warmth. No lining in the sleeves at all. And the lining in the rest is minimal at best. The snaps are a joke. They pop open with the slightest movement. The stitching was coming out down the front.

Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"Not Really ""Rugged"" But Has Grown On Me",4.0,"I'm the kind of guy who usually gets my clothes from Goodwill or Walmart, so $80 was a big spend from me and I had pretty high expectations. I was really looking to replace a shirt/jacket I had that was very tough & rugged and that I wore outdoors all the time - a sort of heavy denim-type material (that looked nicer).This jacket isn't that. What LW calls the ""Weathered Cotton"" isn't that tough at all, though it kind of looks like it would be. In fact, it's kind of smooth, almost velvety but in a pleasant way. I don't know if their marketing phrase ""cotton suede"" is precisely accurate but it's sort of a good description.So I was initially pretty disappointed - I spent what, for me, was a lot of money and I didn't get the outdoors shirt that I could just walk through a bunch of brambles on a deer hunt, or throw under my backside to sit on a rocky beach while fishing, or whatever. But as time has passed, I've noticed that it is a great shirt/jacket for fall weather around town, and despite the rugged-ish look it's reasonably stylish. If you're taking the dog for a walk and then swinging by the bank afterwards, it's perfect. I end up wearing it a lot more than I thought I would, so that has made me come back and sort of reluctantly give it 4 stars.The sizing was fine, for me. The sleeves are longer than most shirts which is a huge plus for me at 6'5"". If you're on the shorter side of average that may be an issue. It's not super-warm, the sleeves are unlined, but if you're looking for a shirt/jacket that's more shirt than jacket, this is probably what you're after.TL/DR - this shirt isn't ""rugged"" or a better-looking version of Carhartt or whatever. But it is a pretty nice shirt and I've come to really like it and I wear the thing all the time now."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Money well spent,5.0,"I just received my jacket today. I read through the reviews and reviews on other websites. I'm a simple man and dropping this much cash on one article of clothing is way outside my comfort zone, especially buying online where I cant touch it and feel the quality and fit. After opening the package and trying it on I feel that my money was well spent. Its exactly what I was looking for.I ordered my regular size (XL) and it fits just as a jacket should. It's not billowing out anywhere but it's big enough that I don't feel constricted anywhere. I tried it on with a thin t shirt but a heavier shirt would be fine under it as well. I am 6ft tall and 230 lbs with a bit of a belly if that helps anyone with sizing. I also have a hard time with shirts and coats sometimes feeling a little too short. This jacket was perfect. It hangs past my waist, even with arms raised but it's not so long that it looks sloppy either.Some people complained about the pockets not being big enough or pockets being in an awkward position. I don't see that at all. My phone fit comfortably in the pocket and I wouldn't worry about it falling out. Keys fit as well. Not sure what else I'd need to put in a pocket that would be a deal breaker. I guess we all have different needs. The position of the pocket was pretty comfortable too. They are a little farther back than normal but not much at all.The jacket was pleasantly heavier than I expected. It feels pretty close to a well broken in denim jacket in weight and in texture on the outside. All the buttons look good and function as they should. The liner is nice. The inner sleeves are slick and not the flannel that is used in the cuffs and the torso area. I like that because it helps to not bunch up long sleeves when putting the jacket on.All and all this is a fantastic jacket for cool weather. It's very stylish yet very functional as well. I would not hesitate to buy this again."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"The listing is a lie, this jacket is only partially cotton lined.",1.0,"I got this jacket because I wanted a warm flannel lined jacket and I was sick of my current polyester lined jacket.This jacket was listed as 100% cotton lined for both sleeves and body. As you can see from my pictures, that was a lie.Which is too bad, I liked it otherwise.1 star for your lies."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"Rugged, good look and nice fit, but should you go down a size?  A couple caveats. . .",4.0,"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11"" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket."

London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Great Fit For My Body Size,5.0,"Plenty of good things have already been said about this jacket which I agree with, so I won't bore you by repeating them here.  My only concern isn't about the product so much, but about how descriptive reviews concerning the fit often fail to describe the person that's wearing the jacket.  To say it's a ""great fit"", ""too long"", ""too tight,"" etc., is worthless unless the reader knows more about the wearer's body.  So here goes . . . I bought a Large size jacket.  I'm 5'10"", at 202 lbs, and have slightly long arms.  (A 34"" sleeve shirt sleeve ends the cuffs near perfectly, about 3/4 inch below my wrist.)  I mention this because this Large size jacket also fits my arm length perfectly, which might make the sleeves a smidgen long for men with more average length arms. (Probably not a big deal tho, as the cuff's snaps should stop the sleeves from sliding into your hand.)  Believe my shoulder and chest width is about average for my height, and the jacket fits well there too, with some jacket slack.  Am happy with the general length of this Large size, but (alas!) I've got a fairly significant gut which makes zipping the jacket a tight fit in that area, so, I'll likely just wear it unzipped, which is rarely a problem in Albuquerque's mostly warm temperatures.  Hope this more descriptive info provides some extra help in figuring out the best size for your order.  PS - Just have to add that the jacket really is a quality buy for the $$$ and ""free"" returns removes any real sizing anxiety."

London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Great price for the quality,5.0,"I was looking for a lightweight jacket for spring, fall and warmer winter days. I have lived in Boise, Id for 10 years and have not seen below zero yet.The jacket is very well made, no loose stitches or threads hanging out. The style  is quite nice, more than just a casual jacket. Very nice attention to detail and finish. It has partial elastic waist bands, shoulder expansion pleats, 7 pockets!!! (3 inside with Velcro closure, (4) outside, 2 with zippers and 2 open for quick access.After seeing this jacket in person and wearing it, I ordered one in Brown. I have spent money on things that were well below my expectations but, this jacket has far exceeded my expectations. I have included a pic of the inside of the jacket."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Good As A Packable Jacket,4.0,"I needed a lightweight jacket that would pack well, had some rain resistance and would match up with a white shirt and black slacks (work attire).  Although not perfect, this London Fog fills the need pretty well.  It has sold well and has, at last glance, over 1700 reviews so lots of details are out there.  Here are my pros and cons:Pros:True to size fit. I am 5'11' and 190lbs. The fit is very comfortable and even has some room for light layering.Packs well and resists wrinkling.Lots of pockets, including three inside that secure with hook and loop fasteners.  Big enough to actually be useful.Bi-swing back provides a wide and comfortable range of movement.Quality workmanship throughout.Cons:Not a ""true"" black, I'd call it a dark, matte charcoal.  Close enough but could be better.Elastic around the waistband tends to cause the waist ride up with movement and stay there, giving a very ""blousy"" look.For the price, fit and workmanship the jacket is five stars.  The two ""cons"" knock it down one star."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Very comfortable soft everyday water resistant jacket made well.,4.0,"Feel inside is great..Very comfortable. The coat is not heavy in weight.  The XL fits around my 5-10 230LB belly. It is light- its a golf coat. For me, its good to 40-45°. But you can wear it inside like when at the store and not overheat.  The BEST part is the 2 ea. dual front pockets.  There are really 4 pockets on front.  2 have zipper closures so your phone doesn't fall out.,.the other 2 are good for your hands.  Also 2 inside breast pockets and 1 little pocket down low inside. The jacket does not restrict your motion- you really could use this golfing!They have elastic around waist-Good. The cuffs are button closures- too bad they have no elastic in the cuff.  I usually have to unsnap the cuffs to take off the coat past my hands. Then put the coat back on and snap the cuffs back. But once on, the cuffs feel good.Weak points  (1) Gray material  under collar.  Should be black like the coat..It is not seen when  collar is down as you would normally wear coat. (2) a bit of static electricity in material. I need to wash it with fabric softener or some other anti-static treatment.Wish list? A little elastic in cuff and maybe a light weight water resistant  hood tucked into the collar. The microfiber outer is Water resistant."

Plenty of great pockets, functional and well placed. The extra shoulder flexibility makes arm movement easier. The black I ordered sure looks as black as my other black coats.This is exactly the light weight jacket I was looking for.  I thought the price was great and could not be happier with the purchase."

Besides two inside  pockets with velcro tabs, it also has an third inside pocket for cell phone or even a wallet, with a velco closure and a flap. Outside has four(!) pockets: two open ones to tuck your hands, and, inconspicuously behind them, two zippered ones for your stuff.  The jacket is not stiff at all.  It's a the right weight for spring or fall. Made in Vietnam."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Excellent light jacket,5.0,"In my area it's only really cold a few days of the year.  While I own several coats and jackets that keep me warm during those few times, they are too warm the rest of the time.  I needed something light, something to keep off a chill while holding off the wind and the occasional light mist.  Enter two great choices:  The London Fog Auburn Jacket and the Weatherproof Classic Golf Jacket.  Both jackets were available from Amazon at reduced prices so I bought both.  The bottom line is I like both and I'm keeping both.  Both are similar and both are winners.  My advice is to buy based on color and cost because you can't really lose.The Weatherproof Classic Golf Jacket differs from the Auburn Jacket by having knit cuffs and bottom edge.  The Auburn Jacket has elastic in the bottom edge and the cuffs snap closed.  I have no preference either way.  The outer fabric of both is microfiber polyester (whatever happened to poly/cotton twill, I wonder).  Both feel like the same weight and look like they could have been cut from the same bolts of cloth except for the colors.  The liners are a little different with the Weatherproof being slightly heavier but in no way bulky or thick.  The Auburn has a lighter feeling fabric inside.  Again, I have no preference either way.  Fit-wise they are very much alike.  The Weatherproof is a little longer in the body than the Auburn when the Auburn is bought in standard sizes.  Personally, I probably should have gotten the tall size of the Auburn but reviews indicated the Auburns sleeves are a bit too long and tall sizes usually have even longer sleeves.  I'm almost exactly six feet tall with a long torso so I can usually go either standard or tall without either seeming off.  I ordered the Auburn in standard length and it's okay but just a tad short.  However, I wouldn't want the sleeves to be any longer.  The Weatherproof fits me perfectly in length and the sleeves are okay too--not as long as those on the Auburn.  I ordered XXL in both jackets and I cannot detect any difference in the fit around the chest or waist.  They're roomy enough in my case for wearing a heavy sweater if need be.  I've worn them with thick sweatshirts but nothing heavier.I've worn both jackets in 45F weather but not in the rain.  Both cut the wind well.  I don't expect either to be waterproof like my Eddie Bauer rain parka.  Probably fine for a light mist or a quick shower.  What I find so great about these jackets is that they're comfortable over a wide range of temperatures.  I can wear one while driving without having to deal with the bulk of a heavier coat and I can wear it indoors for extended periods without feeling overheated.  Even on cold days, I usually only need a jacket for those times I'm outdoors between buildings or from the car to a building.  I only need a really warm coat when I'm outside for more than a few minutes.Which to buy?  Both are great.  I have a tan London Fog Auburn and a light blue Weatherproof Classic Golf.  Both colors will coordinate and match with other colors fine.  The London Fog has more color choices here on Amazon so that might be a factor.  My decision was made based on price.  At the time I bought both jackets, the prices were at a low point and both jackets were bargains.EDIT 01/18/2019:I've worn both these jackets for a while now and I have to give the edge to the London Fog.  That's based on a couple of things about the Weatherproof that wasn't evident at first.  Mainly it has to do with the knit cuffs on the Weatherproof.  In a very short time, they are beginning to pill on the right side of my jacket.  I'm not sure this speaks well for the quality of the fabric for the longterm.  Another thing I did not notice early on is that the cuffs on the Weatherproof do not match.  The left cuff's knit is different from the right.  This might explain the pilling of the right cuff.  However, I admit I like the way the knit cuffs fit compared to the snap cuffs of the London Fog.  On the London Fog, the cuffs feel either too tight or too loose, depending on which snap I use."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Excellent Light-weight Jacket,5.0,"I had been looking for a wind-breaker style jacket for a while in navy and ran across this on amazon. I own other London Fog coats and jackets so I knew the quality would be there without question. And, it is. Being able to purchase it at a great discount on amazon (with quick delivery, I might add) was a great plus.There are four exterior pockets, one on top of the other on each side. The ""top"" pockets are zippered, which is a very nice feature, as I seem to use them a lot. No more having smaller items fall out. There are three interior pockets. Two are actually pretty spacious and are top open access, one left and one right, and secured with velco. The final, lower left side, has a flap, again with Velcro. And there have been times I have used all of them.The material is soft and feels good when wearing. The adjustable snap cuff is an added bonus. The jacket is well-made with good London Fog attention to detail. Two snaps on the sleeve to fit probably any size arm. Sometimes, I even unsnap them, depends on the look I want. As of this writing, my jacket looks exactly as pictured on amazon.Make no mistake. This is not for extreme winter wear. I bought it for spring and fall use, as well as the occasional crisp summer nights. It is perfect for that use. It has even kept me very dry in rain, including some pretty heavy downpours. The microfiber dries out fairly quickly. I have not had any issues with wrinkling.I am quite pleased with, and highly recommend, this jacket. So much so, that I also purchased one in black."

London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Great Fit For My Body Size,5.0,"Plenty of good things have already been said about this jacket which I agree with, so I won't bore you by repeating them here.  My only concern isn't about the product so much, but about how descriptive reviews concerning the fit often fail to describe the person that's wearing the jacket.  To say it's a ""great fit"", ""too long"", ""too tight,"" etc., is worthless unless the reader knows more about the wearer's body.  So here goes . . . I bought a Large size jacket.  I'm 5'10"", at 202 lbs, and have slightly long arms.  (A 34"" sleeve shirt sleeve ends the cuffs near perfectly, about 3/4 inch below my wrist.)  I mention this because this Large size jacket also fits my arm length perfectly, which might make the sleeves a smidgen long for men with more average length arms. (Probably not a big deal tho, as the cuff's snaps should stop the sleeves from sliding into your hand.)  Believe my shoulder and chest width is about average for my height, and the jacket fits well there too, with some jacket slack.  Am happy with the general length of this Large size, but (alas!) I've got a fairly significant gut which makes zipping the jacket a tight fit in that area, so, I'll likely just wear it unzipped, which is rarely a problem in Albuquerque's mostly warm temperatures.  Hope this more descriptive info provides some extra help in figuring out the best size for your order.  PS - Just have to add that the jacket really is a quality buy for the $$$ and ""free"" returns removes any real sizing anxiety."

London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Great price for the quality,5.0,"I was looking for a lightweight jacket for spring, fall and warmer winter days. I have lived in Boise, Id for 10 years and have not seen below zero yet.The jacket is very well made, no loose stitches or threads hanging out. The style  is quite nice, more than just a casual jacket. Very nice attention to detail and finish. It has partial elastic waist bands, shoulder expansion pleats, 7 pockets!!! (3 inside with Velcro closure, (4) outside, 2 with zippers and 2 open for quick access.After seeing this jacket in person and wearing it, I ordered one in Brown. I have spent money on things that were well below my expectations but, this jacket has far exceeded my expectations. I have included a pic of the inside of the jacket."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Good As A Packable Jacket,4.0,"I needed a lightweight jacket that would pack well, had some rain resistance and would match up with a white shirt and black slacks (work attire).  Although not perfect, this London Fog fills the need pretty well.  It has sold well and has, at last glance, over 1700 reviews so lots of details are out there.  Here are my pros and cons:Pros:True to size fit. I am 5'11' and 190lbs. The fit is very comfortable and even has some room for light layering.Packs well and resists wrinkling.Lots of pockets, including three inside that secure with hook and loop fasteners.  Big enough to actually be useful.Bi-swing back provides a wide and comfortable range of movement.Quality workmanship throughout.Cons:Not a ""true"" black, I'd call it a dark, matte charcoal.  Close enough but could be better.Elastic around the waistband tends to cause the waist ride up with movement and stay there, giving a very ""blousy"" look.For the price, fit and workmanship the jacket is five stars.  The two ""cons"" knock it down one star."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Very comfortable soft everyday water resistant jacket made well.,4.0,"Feel inside is great..Very comfortable. The coat is not heavy in weight.  The XL fits around my 5-10 230LB belly. It is light- its a golf coat. For me, its good to 40-45°. But you can wear it inside like when at the store and not overheat.  The BEST part is the 2 ea. dual front pockets.  There are really 4 pockets on front.  2 have zipper closures so your phone doesn't fall out.,.the other 2 are good for your hands.  Also 2 inside breast pockets and 1 little pocket down low inside. The jacket does not restrict your motion- you really could use this golfing!They have elastic around waist-Good. The cuffs are button closures- too bad they have no elastic in the cuff.  I usually have to unsnap the cuffs to take off the coat past my hands. Then put the coat back on and snap the cuffs back. But once on, the cuffs feel good.Weak points  (1) Gray material  under collar.  Should be black like the coat..It is not seen when  collar is down as you would normally wear coat. (2) a bit of static electricity in material. I need to wash it with fabric softener or some other anti-static treatment.Wish list? A little elastic in cuff and maybe a light weight water resistant  hood tucked into the collar. The microfiber outer is Water resistant."

I am 6'3"", 230lbs with a 34"" waist and routinely wear an XL. Based on other's comments regarding the sleeves running long, I bought this in Large. It fits perfectly!! Plenty of great pockets, functional and well placed. The extra shoulder flexibility makes arm movement easier. The black I ordered sure looks as black as my other black coats.This is exactly the light weight jacket I was looking for.  I thought the price was great and could not be happier with the purchase."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Exactly the jacket I was looking for (once I got the right size),4.0,"I originally purchased a medium, because that's what I usually wear, but it fit more like a large.  So I returned it and purchased a small, and it fits perfectly.  This is a really nice jacket.  Not fussy.  Very soft and comfortable -- with plenty of pockets.  Besides two inside  pockets with velcro tabs, it also has an third inside pocket for cell phone or even a wallet, with a velco closure and a flap. Outside has four(!) pockets: two open ones to tuck your hands, and, inconspicuously behind them, two zippered ones for your stuff.  The jacket is not stiff at all.  It's a the right weight for spring or fall. Made in Vietnam."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Excellent light jacket,5.0,"In my area it's only really cold a few days of the year.  While I own several coats and jackets that keep me warm during those few times, they are too warm the rest of the time.  I needed something light, something to keep off a chill while holding off the wind and the occasional light mist.  Enter two great choices:  The London Fog Auburn Jacket and the Weatherproof Classic Golf Jacket.  Both jackets were available from Amazon at reduced prices so I bought both.  The bottom line is I like both and I'm keeping both.  Both are similar and both are winners.  My advice is to buy based on color and cost because you can't really lose.The Weatherproof Classic Golf Jacket differs from the Auburn Jacket by having knit cuffs and bottom edge.  The Auburn Jacket has elastic in the bottom edge and the cuffs snap closed.  I have no preference either way.  The outer fabric of both is microfiber polyester (whatever happened to poly/cotton twill, I wonder).  Both feel like the same weight and look like they could have been cut from the same bolts of cloth except for the colors.  The liners are a little different with the Weatherproof being slightly heavier but in no way bulky or thick.  The Auburn has a lighter feeling fabric inside.  Again, I have no preference either way.  Fit-wise they are very much alike.  The Weatherproof is a little longer in the body than the Auburn when the Auburn is bought in standard sizes.  Personally, I probably should have gotten the tall size of the Auburn but reviews indicated the Auburns sleeves are a bit too long and tall sizes usually have even longer sleeves.  I'm almost exactly six feet tall with a long torso so I can usually go either standard or tall without either seeming off.  I ordered the Auburn in standard length and it's okay but just a tad short.  However, I wouldn't want the sleeves to be any longer.  The Weatherproof fits me perfectly in length and the sleeves are okay too--not as long as those on the Auburn.  I ordered XXL in both jackets and I cannot detect any difference in the fit around the chest or waist.  They're roomy enough in my case for wearing a heavy sweater if need be.

   I bought this specifically for impersonating the Walter White character. I am a medium to slim  build guy, very average body type. This fits perfectly. The color is Camel. Washed and machine dried, no issues. Money well spent for the purpose I wanted it for.I'm 6'0"", 180 lbs. I take a 40 Long Sports coat or suit jacket. So you can see how this jacket fits me by comparison.UPDATE: Bought my third one, in black this time. Heisenberg - ""Breaking Bass"""
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Great price for the quality,5.0,"I was looking for a lightweight jacket for spring, fall and warmer winter days. I have lived in Boise, Id for 10 years and have not seen below zero yet.The jacket is very well made, no loose stitches or threads hanging out. The style  is quite nice, more than just a casual jacket. Very nice attention to detail and finish. It has partial elastic waist bands, shoulder expansion pleats, 7 pockets!!! (3 inside with Velcro closure, (4) outside, 2 with zippers and 2 open for quick access.After seeing this jacket in person and wearing it, I ordered one in Brown. I have spent money on things that were well below my expectations but, this jacket has far exceeded my expectations. I have included a pic of the inside of the jacket."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Good As A Packable Jacket,4.0,"I needed a lightweight jacket that would pack well, had some rain resistance and would match up with a white shirt and black slacks (work attire).  Although not perfect, this London Fog fills the need pretty well.  It has sold well and has, at last glance, over 1700 reviews so lots of details are out there.  Here are my pros and cons:Pros:True to size fit. I am 5'11' and 190lbs. The fit is very comfortable and even has some room for light layering.Packs well and resists wrinkling.Lots of pockets, including three inside that secure with hook and loop fasteners.  Big enough to actually be useful.Bi-swing back provides a wide and comfortable range of movement.Quality workmanship throughout.Cons:Not a ""true"" black, I'd call it a dark, matte charcoal.  Close enough but could be better.Elastic around the waistband tends to cause the waist ride up with movement and stay there, giving a very ""blousy"" look.For the price, fit and workmanship the jacket is five stars.  The two ""cons"" knock it down one star."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Very comfortable soft everyday water resistant jacket made well.,4.0,"Feel inside is great..Very comfortable. The coat is not heavy in weight.  The XL fits around my 5-10 230LB belly. It is light- its a golf coat. For me, its good to 40-45°. But you can wear it inside like when at the store and not overheat.  The BEST part is the 2 ea. dual front pockets.  There are really 4 pockets on front.  2 have zipper closures so your phone doesn't fall out.,.the other 2 are good for your hands.  Also 2 inside breast pockets and 1 little pocket down low inside. The jacket does not restrict your motion- you really could use this golfing!They have elastic around waist-Good. The cuffs are button closures- too bad they have no elastic in the cuff.  I usually have to unsnap the cuffs to take off the coat past my hands. Then put the coat back on and snap the cuffs back. But once on, the cuffs feel good.Weak points  (1) Gray material  under collar.  Should be black like the coat..It is not seen when  collar is down as you would normally wear coat. (2) a bit of static electricity in material. I need to wash it with fabric softener or some other anti-static treatment.Wish list? A little elastic in cuff and maybe a light weight water resistant  hood tucked into the collar. The microfiber outer is Water resistant."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Perfect But Pay Attention to the Sizing Comments,5.0,"First a BIG THANK YOU to all who wrote about the long sleeve length and fuller body fit. I am 6'3"", 230lbs with a 34"" waist and routinely wear an XL. Based on other's comments regarding the sleeves running long, I bought this in Large. It fits perfectly!! Plenty of great pockets, functional and well placed. The extra shoulder flexibility makes arm movement easier. The black I ordered sure looks as black as my other black coats.This is exactly the light weight jacket I was looking for.  I thought the price was great and could not be happier with the purchase."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Exactly the jacket I was looking for (once I got the right size),4.0,"I originally purchased a medium, because that's what I usually wear, but it fit more like a large.  So I returned it and purchased a small, and it fits perfectly.  This is a really nice jacket.  Not fussy.  Very soft and comfortable -- with plenty of pockets.  Besides two inside  pockets with velcro tabs, it also has an third inside pocket for cell phone or even a wallet, with a velco closure and a flap. Outside has four(!) pockets: two open ones to tuck your hands, and, inconspicuously behind them, two zippered ones for your stuff.  The jacket is not stiff at all.  It's a the right weight for spring or fall. Made in Vietnam."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Excellent light jacket,5.0,"In my area it's only really cold a few days of the year.  While I own several coats and jackets that keep me warm during those few times, they are too warm the rest of the time.  I needed something light, something to keep off a chill while holding off the wind and the occasional light mist.  Enter two great choices:  The London Fog Auburn Jacket and the Weatherproof Classic Golf Jacket.  Both jackets were available from Amazon at reduced prices so I bought both.  The bottom line is I like both and I'm keeping both.  Both are similar and both are winners.  My advice is to buy based on color and cost because you can't really lose.The Weatherproof Classic Golf Jacket differs from the Auburn Jacket by having knit cuffs and bottom edge.  The Auburn Jacket has elastic in the bottom edge and the cuffs snap closed.  I have no preference either way.  The outer fabric of both is microfiber polyester (whatever happened to poly/cotton twill, I wonder).  Both feel like the same weight and look like they could have been cut from the same bolts of cloth except for the colors.  The liners are a little different with the Weatherproof being slightly heavier but in no way bulky or thick.  The Auburn has a lighter feeling fabric inside.  Again, I have no preference either way.  Fit-wise they are very much alike.  The Weatherproof is a little longer in the body than the Auburn when the Auburn is bought in standard sizes.  Personally, I probably should have gotten the tall size of the Auburn but reviews indicated the Auburns sleeves are a bit too long and tall sizes usually have even longer sleeves.  I'm almost exactly six feet tall with a long torso so I can usually go either standard or tall without either seeming off.  I ordered the Auburn in standard length and it's okay but just a tad short.  However, I wouldn't want the sleeves to be any longer.  The Weatherproof fits me perfectly in length and the sleeves are okay too--not as long as those on the Auburn.  I ordered XXL in both jackets and I cannot detect any difference in the fit around the chest or waist.  They're roomy enough in my case for wearing a heavy sweater if need be.  I've worn them with thick sweatshirts but nothing heavier.I've worn both jackets in 45F weather but not in the rain.  Both cut the wind well.  I don't expect either to be waterproof like my Eddie Bauer rain parka.  Probably fine for a light mist or a quick shower.  What I find so great about these jackets is that they're comfortable over a wide range of temperatures.  I can wear one while driving without having to deal with the bulk of a heavier coat and I can wear it indoors for extended periods without feeling overheated.  Even on cold days, I usually only need a jacket for those times I'm outdoors between buildings or from the car to a building.  I only need a really warm coat when I'm outside for more than a few minutes.Which to buy?  Both are great.  I have a tan London Fog Auburn and a light blue Weatherproof Classic Golf.  Both colors will coordinate and match with other colors fine.  The London Fog has more color choices here on Amazon so that might be a factor.  My decision was made based on price.  At the time I bought both jackets, the prices were at a low point and both jackets were bargains.EDIT 01/18/2019:I've worn both these jackets for a while now and I have to give the edge to the London Fog.  That's based on a couple of things about the Weatherproof that wasn't evident at first.  Mainly it has to do with the knit cuffs on the Weatherproof.  In a very short time, they are beginning to pill on the right side of my jacket.  I'm not sure this speaks well for the quality of the fabric for the longterm.  Another thing I did not notice early on is that the cuffs on the Weatherproof do not match.  The left cuff's knit is different from the right.  This might explain the pilling of the right cuff.  However, I admit I like the way the knit cuffs fit compared to the snap cuffs of the London Fog.  On the London Fog, the cuffs feel either too tight or too loose, depending on which snap I use."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Excellent Light-weight Jacket,5.0,"I had been looking for a wind-breaker style jacket for a while in navy and ran across this on amazon. I own other London Fog coats and jackets so I knew the quality would be there without question. And, it is. Being able to purchase it at a great discount on amazon (with quick delivery, I might add) was a great plus.There are four exterior pockets, one on top of the other on each side. The ""top"" pockets are zippered, which is a very nice feature, as I seem to use them a lot. No more having smaller items fall out. There are three interior pockets. Two are actually pretty spacious and are top open access, one left and one right, and secured with velco. The final, lower left side, has a flap, again with Velcro. And there have been times I have used all of them.The material is soft and feels good when wearing. The adjustable snap cuff is an added bonus. The jacket is well-made with good London Fog attention to detail. Two snaps on the sleeve to fit probably any size arm. Sometimes, I even unsnap them, depends on the look I want. As of this writing, my jacket looks exactly as pictured on amazon.Make no mistake. This is not for extreme winter wear. I bought it for spring and fall use, as well as the occasional crisp summer nights. It is perfect for that use. It has even kept me very dry in rain, including some pretty heavy downpours. The microfiber dries out fairly quickly. I have not had any issues with wrinkling.I am quite pleased with, and highly recommend, this jacket. So much so, that I also purchased one in black."

   I'm happy with my purchase. When I bought mine (from amazon.com), it was about $12 cheaper for some reason. Even at the current price, though (about $35), it's a good buy.Anyway, please see my video review.Oh, just for reference, I'm about 5'5"" = 165cm tall (or short, depending on how you view things)."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Great Fit For My Body Size,5.0,"Plenty of good things have already been said about this jacket which I agree with, so I won't bore you by repeating them here.  My only concern isn't about the product so much, but about how descriptive reviews concerning the fit often fail to describe the person that's wearing the jacket.  To say it's a ""great fit"", ""too long"", ""too tight,"" etc., is worthless unless the reader knows more about the wearer's body.  So here goes . . . I bought a Large size jacket.  I'm 5'10"", at 202 lbs, and have slightly long arms.  (A 34"" sleeve shirt sleeve ends the cuffs near perfectly, about 3/4 inch below my wrist.)  I mention this because this Large size jacket also fits my arm length perfectly, which might make the sleeves a smidgen long for men with more average length arms. (Probably not a big deal tho, as the cuff's snaps should stop the sleeves from sliding into your hand.)  Believe my shoulder and chest width is about average for my height, and the jacket fits well there too, with some jacket slack.  Am happy with the general length of this Large size, but (alas!) I've got a fairly significant gut which makes zipping the jacket a tight fit in that area, so, I'll likely just wear it unzipped, which is rarely a problem in Albuquerque's mostly warm temperatures.  Hope this more descriptive info provides some extra help in figuring out the best size for your order.  PS - Just have to add that the jacket really is a quality buy for the $$$ and ""free"" returns removes any real sizing anxiety."

Enter two great choices:  The London Fog Auburn Jacket and the Weatherproof Classic Golf Jacket.  Both jackets were available from Amazon at reduced prices so I bought both.  The bottom line is I like both and I'm keeping both.  Both are similar and both are winners.  My advice is to buy based on color and cost because you can't really lose.The Weatherproof Classic Golf Jacket differs from the Auburn Jacket by having knit cuffs and bottom edge.  The Auburn Jacket has elastic in the bottom edge and the cuffs snap closed.  I have no preference either way.  The outer fabric of both is microfiber polyester (whatever happened to poly/cotton twill, I wonder).  Both feel like the same weight and look like they could have been cut from the same bolts of cloth except for the colors.  The liners are a little different with the Weatherproof being slightly heavier but in no way bulky or thick.  The Auburn has a lighter feeling fabric inside.  Again, I have no preference either way.  Fit-wise they are very much alike.  The Weatherproof is a little longer in the body than the Auburn when the Auburn is bought in standard sizes.  Personally, I probably should have gotten the tall size of the Auburn but reviews indicated the Auburns sleeves are a bit too long and tall sizes usually have even longer sleeves.  I'm almost exactly six feet tall with a long torso so I can usually go either standard or tall without either seeming off.  I ordered the Auburn in standard length and it's okay but just a tad short.  However, I wouldn't want the sleeves to be any longer.  The Weatherproof fits me perfectly in length and the sleeves are okay too--not as long as those on the Auburn.  I ordered XXL in both jackets and I cannot detect any difference in the fit around the chest or waist.  They're roomy enough in my case for wearing a heavy sweater if need be.  I've worn them with thick sweatshirts but nothing heavier.I've worn both jackets in 45F weather but not in the rain.  Both cut the wind well.  I don't expect either to be waterproof like my Eddie Bauer rain parka.  Probably fine for a light mist or a quick shower.  What I find so great about these jackets is that they're comfortable over a wide range of temperatures.  I can wear one while driving without having to deal with the bulk of a heavier coat and I can wear it indoors for extended periods without feeling overheated.  Even on cold days, I usually only need a jacket for those times I'm outdoors between buildings or from the car to a building.  I only need a really warm coat when I'm outside for more than a few minutes.Which to buy?  Both are great.  I have a tan London Fog Auburn and a light blue Weatherproof Classic Golf.  Both colors will coordinate and match with other colors fine.  The London Fog has more color choices here on Amazon so that might be a factor.  My decision was made based on price.  At the time I bought both jackets, the prices were at a low point and both jackets were bargains.EDIT 01/18/2019:I've worn both these jackets for a while now and I have to give the edge to the London Fog.  That's based on a couple of things about the Weatherproof that wasn't evident at first.  Mainly it has to do with the knit cuffs on the Weatherproof.  In a very short time, they are beginning to pill on the right side of my jacket.  I'm not sure this speaks well for the quality of the fabric for the longterm.  Another thing I did not notice early on is that the cuffs on the Weatherproof do not match.  The left cuff's knit is different from the right.  This might explain the pilling of the right cuff.  However, I admit I like the way the knit cuffs fit compared to the snap cuffs of the London Fog.  On the London Fog, the cuffs feel either too tight or too loose, depending on which snap I use."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Excellent Light-weight Jacket,5.0,"I had been looking for a wind-breaker style jacket for a while in navy and ran across this on amazon. I own other London Fog coats and jackets so I knew the quality would be there without question. And, it is. Being able to purchase it at a great discount on amazon (with quick delivery, I might add) was a great plus.There are four exterior pockets, one on top of the other on each side. The ""top"" pockets are zippered, which is a very nice feature, as I seem to use them a lot. No more having smaller items fall out. There are three interior pockets. Two are actually pretty spacious and are top open access, one left and one right, and secured with velco. The final, lower left side, has a flap, again with Velcro. And there have been times I have used all of them.The material is soft and feels good when wearing. The adjustable snap cuff is an added bonus. The jacket is well-made with good London Fog attention to detail. Two snaps on the sleeve to fit probably any size arm. Sometimes, I even unsnap them, depends on the look I want. As of this writing, my jacket looks exactly as pictured on amazon.Make no mistake. This is not for extreme winter wear. I bought it for spring and fall use, as well as the occasional crisp summer nights. It is perfect for that use. It has even kept me very dry in rain, including some pretty heavy downpours. The microfiber dries out fairly quickly. I have not had any issues with wrinkling.I am quite pleased with, and highly recommend, this jacket. So much so, that I also purchased one in black."

London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Great Fit For My Body Size,5.0,"Plenty of good things have already been said about this jacket which I agree with, so I won't bore you by repeating them here.  My only concern isn't about the product so much, but about how descriptive reviews concerning the fit often fail to describe the person that's wearing the jacket.  To say it's a ""great fit"", ""too long"", ""too tight,"" etc., is worthless unless the reader knows more about the wearer's body.  So here goes . . . I bought a Large size jacket.  I'm 5'10"", at 202 lbs, and have slightly long arms.  (A 34"" sleeve shirt sleeve ends the cuffs near perfectly, about 3/4 inch below my wrist.)  I mention this because this Large size jacket also fits my arm length perfectly, which might make the sleeves a smidgen long for men with more average length arms. (Probably not a big deal tho, as the cuff's snaps should stop the sleeves from sliding into your hand.)  Believe my shoulder and chest width is about average for my height, and the jacket fits well there too, with some jacket slack.  Am happy with the general length of this Large size, but (alas!) I've got a fairly significant gut which makes zipping the jacket a tight fit in that area, so, I'll likely just wear it unzipped, which is rarely a problem in Albuquerque's mostly warm temperatures.  Hope this more descriptive info provides some extra help in figuring out the best size for your order.  PS - Just have to add that the jacket really is a quality buy for the $$$ and ""free"" returns removes any real sizing anxiety."

London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Great price for the quality,5.0,"I was looking for a lightweight jacket for spring, fall and warmer winter days. I have lived in Boise, Id for 10 years and have not seen below zero yet.The jacket is very well made, no loose stitches or threads hanging out. The style  is quite nice, more than just a casual jacket. Very nice attention to detail and finish. It has partial elastic waist bands, shoulder expansion pleats, 7 pockets!!! (3 inside with Velcro closure, (4) outside, 2 with zippers and 2 open for quick access.After seeing this jacket in person and wearing it, I ordered one in Brown. I have spent money on things that were well below my expectations but, this jacket has far exceeded my expectations. I have included a pic of the inside of the jacket."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Good As A Packable Jacket,4.0,"I needed a lightweight jacket that would pack well, had some rain resistance and would match up with a white shirt and black slacks (work attire).  Although not perfect, this London Fog fills the need pretty well.  It has sold well and has, at last glance, over 1700 reviews so lots of details are out there.  Here are my pros and cons:Pros:True to size fit. I am 5'11' and 190lbs. The fit is very comfortable and even has some room for light layering.Packs well and resists wrinkling.Lots of pockets, including three inside that secure with hook and loop fasteners.  Big enough to actually be useful.Bi-swing back provides a wide and comfortable range of movement.Quality workmanship throughout.Cons:Not a ""true"" black, I'd call it a dark, matte charcoal.  Close enough but could be better.Elastic around the waistband tends to cause the waist ride up with movement and stay there, giving a very ""blousy"" look.For the price, fit and workmanship the jacket is five stars.  The two ""cons"" knock it down one star."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Very comfortable soft everyday water resistant jacket made well.,4.0,"Feel inside is great..Very comfortable. The coat is not heavy in weight.  The XL fits around my 5-10 230LB belly. It is light- its a golf coat. For me, its good to 40-45°. But you can wear it inside like when at the store and not overheat.  The BEST part is the 2 ea. dual front pockets.  There are really 4 pockets on front.  2 have zipper closures so your phone doesn't fall out.,.the other 2 are good for your hands.  Also 2 inside breast pockets and 1 little pocket down low inside. The jacket does not restrict your motion- you really could use this golfing!They have elastic around waist-Good. The cuffs are button closures- too bad they have no elastic in the cuff.  I usually have to unsnap the cuffs to take off the coat past my hands. Then put the coat back on and snap the cuffs back. But once on, the cuffs feel good.Weak points  (1) Gray material  under collar.  Should be black like the coat..It is not seen when  collar is down as you would normally wear coat. (2) a bit of static electricity in material. I need to wash it with fabric softener or some other anti-static treatment.Wish list? A little elastic in cuff and maybe a light weight water resistant  hood tucked into the collar. The microfiber outer is Water resistant."

Plenty of great pockets, functional and well placed. The extra shoulder flexibility makes arm movement easier. The black I ordered sure looks as black as my other black coats.This is exactly the light weight jacket I was looking for.  I thought the price was great and could not be happier with the purchase."

Besides two inside  pockets with velcro tabs, it also has an third inside pocket for cell phone or even a wallet, with a velco closure and a flap. Outside has four(!) pockets: two open ones to tuck your hands, and, inconspicuously behind them, two zippered ones for your stuff.  The jacket is not stiff at all.

London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Great Fit For My Body Size,5.0,"Plenty of good things have already been said about this jacket which I agree with, so I won't bore you by repeating them here.  My only concern isn't about the product so much, but about how descriptive reviews concerning the fit often fail to describe the person that's wearing the jacket.  To say it's a ""great fit"", ""too long"", ""too tight,"" etc., is worthless unless the reader knows more about the wearer's body.  So here goes . . . I bought a Large size jacket.  I'm 5'10"", at 202 lbs, and have slightly long arms.  (A 34"" sleeve shirt sleeve ends the cuffs near perfectly, about 3/4 inch below my wrist.)  I mention this because this Large size jacket also fits my arm length perfectly, which might make the sleeves a smidgen long for men with more average length arms. (Probably not a big deal tho, as the cuff's snaps should stop the sleeves from sliding into your hand.)  Believe my shoulder and chest width is about average for my height, and the jacket fits well there too, with some jacket slack.  Am happy with the general length of this Large size, but (alas!) I've got a fairly significant gut which makes zipping the jacket a tight fit in that area, so, I'll likely just wear it unzipped, which is rarely a problem in Albuquerque's mostly warm temperatures.  Hope this more descriptive info provides some extra help in figuring out the best size for your order.  PS - Just have to add that the jacket really is a quality buy for the $$$ and ""free"" returns removes any real sizing anxiety."

London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Great price for the quality,5.0,"I was looking for a lightweight jacket for spring, fall and warmer winter days. I have lived in Boise, Id for 10 years and have not seen below zero yet.The jacket is very well made, no loose stitches or threads hanging out. The style  is quite nice, more than just a casual jacket. Very nice attention to detail and finish. It has partial elastic waist bands, shoulder expansion pleats, 7 pockets!!! (3 inside with Velcro closure, (4) outside, 2 with zippers and 2 open for quick access.After seeing this jacket in person and wearing it, I ordered one in Brown. I have spent money on things that were well below my expectations but, this jacket has far exceeded my expectations. I have included a pic of the inside of the jacket."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Good As A Packable Jacket,4.0,"I needed a lightweight jacket that would pack well, had some rain resistance and would match up with a white shirt and black slacks (work attire).  Although not perfect, this London Fog fills the need pretty well.  It has sold well and has, at last glance, over 1700 reviews so lots of details are out there.  Here are my pros and cons:Pros:True to size fit. I am 5'11' and 190lbs. The fit is very comfortable and even has some room for light layering.Packs well and resists wrinkling.Lots of pockets, including three inside that secure with hook and loop fasteners.  Big enough to actually be useful.Bi-swing back provides a wide and comfortable range of movement.Quality workmanship throughout.Cons:Not a ""true"" black, I'd call it a dark, matte charcoal.  Close enough but could be better.Elastic around the waistband tends to cause the waist ride up with movement and stay there, giving a very ""blousy"" look.For the price, fit and workmanship the jacket is five stars.  The two ""cons"" knock it down one star."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Very comfortable soft everyday water resistant jacket made well.,4.0,"Feel inside is great..Very comfortable. The coat is not heavy in weight.  The XL fits around my 5-10 230LB belly. It is light- its a golf coat. For me, its good to 40-45°. But you can wear it inside like when at the store and not overheat.  The BEST part is the 2 ea. dual front pockets.  There are really 4 pockets on front.  2 have zipper closures so your phone doesn't fall out.,.the other 2 are good for your hands.  Also 2 inside breast pockets and 1 little pocket down low inside. The jacket does not restrict your motion- you really could use this golfing!They have elastic around waist-Good. The cuffs are button closures- too bad they have no elastic in the cuff.  I usually have to unsnap the cuffs to take off the coat past my hands. Then put the coat back on and snap the cuffs back. But once on, the cuffs feel good.Weak points  (1) Gray material  under collar.  Should be black like the coat..It is not seen when  collar is down as you would normally wear coat. (2) a bit of static electricity in material. I need to wash it with fabric softener or some other anti-static treatment.Wish list? A little elastic in cuff and maybe a light weight water resistant  hood tucked into the collar. The microfiber outer is Water resistant."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Perfect But Pay Attention to the Sizing Comments,5.0,"First a BIG THANK YOU to all who wrote about the long sleeve length and fuller body fit. I am 6'3"", 230lbs with a 34"" waist and routinely wear an XL. Based on other's comments regarding the sleeves running long, I bought this in Large. It fits perfectly!! Plenty of great pockets, functional and well placed. The extra shoulder flexibility makes arm movement easier. The black I ordered sure looks as black as my other black coats.This is exactly the light weight jacket I was looking for.  I thought the price was great and could not be happier with the purchase."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Exactly the jacket I was looking for (once I got the right size),4.0,"I originally purchased a medium, because that's what I usually wear, but it fit more like a large.  So I returned it and purchased a small, and it fits perfectly.  This is a really nice jacket.  Not fussy.  Very soft and comfortable -- with plenty of pockets.  Besides two inside  pockets with velcro tabs, it also has an third inside pocket for cell phone or even a wallet, with a velco closure and a flap. Outside has four(!) pockets: two open ones to tuck your hands, and, inconspicuously behind them, two zippered ones for your stuff.  The jacket is not stiff at all.  It's a the right weight for spring or fall. Made in Vietnam."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Excellent light jacket,5.0,"In my area it's only really cold a few days of the year.  While I own several coats and jackets that keep me warm during those few times, they are too warm the rest of the time.  I needed something light, something to keep off a chill while holding off the wind and the occasional light mist.  Enter two great choices:  The London Fog Auburn Jacket and the Weatherproof Classic Golf Jacket.  Both jackets were available from Amazon at reduced prices so I bought both.  The bottom line is I like both and I'm keeping both.  Both are similar and both are winners.  My advice is to buy based on color and cost because you can't really lose.The Weatherproof Classic Golf Jacket differs from the Auburn Jacket by having knit cuffs and bottom edge.  The Auburn Jacket has elastic in the bottom edge and the cuffs snap closed.  I have no preference either way.  The outer fabric of both is microfiber polyester (whatever happened to poly/cotton twill, I wonder).  Both feel like the same weight and look like they could have been cut from the same bolts of cloth except for the colors.  The liners are a little different with the Weatherproof being slightly heavier but in no way bulky or thick.  The Auburn has a lighter feeling fabric inside.  Again, I have no preference either way.  Fit-wise they are very much alike.  The Weatherproof is a little longer in the body than the Auburn when the Auburn is bought in standard sizes.  Personally, I probably should have gotten the tall size of the Auburn but reviews indicated the Auburns sleeves are a bit too long and tall sizes usually have even longer sleeves.  I'm almost exactly six feet tall with a long torso so I can usually go either standard or tall without either seeming off.  I ordered the Auburn in standard length and it's okay but just a tad short.  However, I wouldn't want the sleeves to be any longer.  The Weatherproof fits me perfectly in length and the sleeves are okay too--not as long as those on the Auburn.  I ordered XXL in both jackets and I cannot detect any difference in the fit around the chest or waist.  They're roomy enough in my case for wearing a heavy sweater if need be.  I've worn them with thick sweatshirts but nothing heavier.I've worn both jackets in 45F weather but not in the rain.  Both cut the wind well.  I don't expect either to be waterproof like my Eddie Bauer rain parka.  Probably fine for a light mist or a quick shower.  What I find so great about these jackets is that they're comfortable over a wide range of temperatures.  I can wear one while driving without having to deal with the bulk of a heavier coat and I can wear it indoors for extended periods without feeling overheated.  Even on cold days, I usually only need a jacket for those times I'm outdoors between buildings or from the car to a building.  I only need a really warm coat when I'm outside for more than a few minutes.Which to buy?  Both are great.  I have a tan London Fog Auburn and a light blue Weatherproof Classic Golf.  Both colors will coordinate and match with other colors fine.  The London Fog has more color choices here on Amazon so that might be a factor.  My decision was made based on price.  At the time I bought both jackets, the prices were at a low point and both jackets were bargains.EDIT 01/18/2019:I've worn both these jackets for a while now and I have to give the edge to the London Fog.  That's based on a couple of things about the Weatherproof that wasn't evident at first.  Mainly it has to do with the knit cuffs on the Weatherproof.  In a very short time, they are beginning to pill on the right side of my jacket.  I'm not sure this speaks well for the quality of the fabric for the longterm.  Another thing I did not notice early on is that the cuffs on the Weatherproof do not match.  The left cuff's knit is different from the right.  This might explain the pilling of the right cuff.  However, I admit I like the way the knit cuffs fit compared to the snap cuffs of the London Fog.  On the London Fog, the cuffs feel either too tight or too loose, depending on which snap I use."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Excellent Light-weight Jacket,5.0,"I had been looking for a wind-breaker style jacket for a while in navy and ran across this on amazon. I own other London Fog coats and jackets so I knew the quality would be there without question. And, it is. Being able to purchase it at a great discount on amazon (with quick delivery, I might add) was a great plus.There are four exterior pockets, one on top of the other on each side. The ""top"" pockets are zippered, which is a very nice feature, as I seem to use them a lot. No more having smaller items fall out. There are three interior pockets. Two are actually pretty spacious and are top open access, one left and one right, and secured with velco. The final, lower left side, has a flap, again with Velcro. And there have been times I have used all of them.The material is soft and feels good when wearing. The adjustable snap cuff is an added bonus. The jacket is well-made with good London Fog attention to detail. Two snaps on the sleeve to fit probably any size arm. Sometimes, I even unsnap them, depends on the look I want. As of this writing, my jacket looks exactly as pictured on amazon.Make no mistake. This is not for extreme winter wear. I bought it for spring and fall use, as well as the occasional crisp summer nights. It is perfect for that use. It has even kept me very dry in rain, including some pretty heavy downpours. The microfiber dries out fairly quickly. I have not had any issues with wrinkling.I am quite pleased with, and highly recommend, this jacket. So much so, that I also purchased one in black."

London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Perfect But Pay Attention to the Sizing Comments,5.0,"First a BIG THANK YOU to all who wrote about the long sleeve length and fuller body fit. I am 6'3"", 230lbs with a 34"" waist and routinely wear an XL. Based on other's comments regarding the sleeves running long, I bought this in Large. It fits perfectly!! Plenty of great pockets, functional and well placed. The extra shoulder flexibility makes arm movement easier. The black I ordered sure looks as black as my other black coats.This is exactly the light weight jacket I was looking for.  I thought the price was great and could not be happier with the purchase."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Exactly the jacket I was looking for (once I got the right size),4.0,"I originally purchased a medium, because that's what I usually wear, but it fit more like a large.  So I returned it and purchased a small, and it fits perfectly.  This is a really nice jacket.  Not fussy.  Very soft and comfortable -- with plenty of pockets.  Besides two inside  pockets with velcro tabs, it also has an third inside pocket for cell phone or even a wallet, with a velco closure and a flap. Outside has four(!) pockets: two open ones to tuck your hands, and, inconspicuously behind them, two zippered ones for your stuff.  The jacket is not stiff at all.  It's a the right weight for spring or fall. Made in Vietnam."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Excellent light jacket,5.0,"In my area it's only really cold a few days of the year.  While I own several coats and jackets that keep me warm during those few times, they are too warm the rest of the time.  I needed something light, something to keep off a chill while holding off the wind and the occasional light mist.  Enter two great choices:  The London Fog Auburn Jacket and the Weatherproof Classic Golf Jacket.  Both jackets were available from Amazon at reduced prices so I bought both.  The bottom line is I like both and I'm keeping both.  Both are similar and both are winners.  My advice is to buy based on color and cost because you can't really lose.The Weatherproof Classic Golf Jacket differs from the Auburn Jacket by having knit cuffs and bottom edge.  The Auburn Jacket has elastic in the bottom edge and the cuffs snap closed.  I have no preference either way.  The outer fabric of both is microfiber polyester (whatever happened to poly/cotton twill, I wonder).  Both feel like the same weight and look like they could have been cut from the same bolts of cloth except for the colors.  The liners are a little different with the Weatherproof being slightly heavier but in no way bulky or thick.  The Auburn has a lighter feeling fabric inside.  Again, I have no preference either way.  Fit-wise they are very much alike.  The Weatherproof is a little longer in the body than the Auburn when the Auburn is bought in standard sizes.  Personally, I probably should have gotten the tall size of the Auburn but reviews indicated the Auburns sleeves are a bit too long and tall sizes usually have even longer sleeves.  I'm almost exactly six feet tall with a long torso so I can usually go either standard or tall without either seeming off.  I ordered the Auburn in standard length and it's okay but just a tad short.  However, I wouldn't want the sleeves to be any longer.  The Weatherproof fits me perfectly in length and the sleeves are okay too--not as long as those on the Auburn.  I ordered XXL in both jackets and I cannot detect any difference in the fit around the chest or waist.  They're roomy enough in my case for wearing a heavy sweater if need be.  I've worn them with thick sweatshirts but nothing heavier.I've worn both jackets in 45F weather but not in the rain.  Both cut the wind well.  I don't expect either to be waterproof like my Eddie Bauer rain parka.  Probably fine for a light mist or a quick shower.  What I find so great about these jackets is that they're comfortable over a wide range of temperatures.  I can wear one while driving without having to deal with the bulk of a heavier coat and I can wear it indoors for extended periods without feeling overheated.  Even on cold days, I usually only need a jacket for those times I'm outdoors between buildings or from the car to a building.  I only need a really warm coat when I'm outside for more than a few minutes.Which to buy?  Both are great.  I have a tan London Fog Auburn and a light blue Weatherproof Classic Golf.  Both colors will coordinate and match with other colors fine.  The London Fog has more color choices here on Amazon so that might be a factor.  My decision was made based on price.  At the time I bought both jackets, the prices were at a low point and both jackets were bargains.EDIT 01/18/2019:I've worn both these jackets for a while now and I have to give the edge to the London Fog.  That's based on a couple of things about the Weatherproof that wasn't evident at first.  Mainly it has to do with the knit cuffs on the Weatherproof.  In a very short time, they are beginning to pill on the right side of my jacket.  I'm not sure this speaks well for the quality of the fabric for the longterm.  Another thing I did not notice early on is that the cuffs on the Weatherproof do not match.  The left cuff's knit is different from the right.  This might explain the pilling of the right cuff.  However, I admit I like the way the knit cuffs fit compared to the snap cuffs of the London Fog.  On the London Fog, the cuffs feel either too tight or too loose, depending on which snap I use."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Excellent Light-weight Jacket,5.0,"I had been looking for a wind-breaker style jacket for a while in navy and ran across this on amazon. I own other London Fog coats and jackets so I knew the quality would be there without question. And, it is. Being able to purchase it at a great discount on amazon (with quick delivery, I might add) was a great plus.There are four exterior pockets, one on top of the other on each side. The ""top"" pockets are zippered, which is a very nice feature, as I seem to use them a lot. No more having smaller items fall out. There are three interior pockets. Two are actually pretty spacious and are top open access, one left and one right, and secured with velco. The final, lower left side, has a flap, again with Velcro. And there have been times I have used all of them.The material is soft and feels good when wearing. The adjustable snap cuff is an added bonus. The jacket is well-made with good London Fog attention to detail. Two snaps on the sleeve to fit probably any size arm. Sometimes, I even unsnap them, depends on the look I want. As of this writing, my jacket looks exactly as pictured on amazon.Make no mistake. This is not for extreme winter wear. I bought it for spring and fall use, as well as the occasional crisp summer nights. It is perfect for that use. It has even kept me very dry in rain, including some pretty heavy downpours. The microfiber dries out fairly quickly. I have not had any issues with wrinkling.I am quite pleased with, and highly recommend, this jacket. So much so, that I also purchased one in black."

   I'm happy with my purchase. When I bought mine (from amazon.com), it was about $12 cheaper for some reason. Even at the current price, though (about $35), it's a good buy.Anyway, please see my video review.Oh, just for reference, I'm about 5'5"" = 165cm tall (or short, depending on how you view things)."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Great Fit For My Body Size,5.0,"Plenty of good things have already been said about this jacket which I agree with, so I won't bore you by repeating them here.  My only concern isn't about the product so much, but about how descriptive reviews concerning the fit often fail to describe the person that's wearing the jacket.  To say it's a ""great fit"", ""too long"", ""too tight,"" etc., is worthless unless the reader knows more about the wearer's body.  So here goes . . . I bought a Large size jacket.  I'm 5'10"", at 202 lbs, and have slightly long arms.  (A 34"" sleeve shirt sleeve ends the cuffs near perfectly, about 3/4 inch below my wrist.)  I mention this because this Large size jacket also fits my arm length perfectly, which might make the sleeves a smidgen long for men with more average length arms. (Probably not a big deal tho, as the cuff's snaps should stop the sleeves from sliding into your hand.)  Believe my shoulder and chest width is about average for my height, and the jacket fits well there too, with some jacket slack.  Am happy with the general length of this Large size, but (alas!) I've got a fairly significant gut which makes zipping the jacket a tight fit in that area, so, I'll likely just wear it unzipped, which is rarely a problem in Albuquerque's mostly warm temperatures.  Hope this more descriptive info provides some extra help in figuring out the best size for your order.  PS - Just have to add that the jacket really is a quality buy for the $$$ and ""free"" returns removes any real sizing anxiety."

I have lived in Boise, Id for 10 years and have not seen below zero yet.The jacket is very well made, no loose stitches or threads hanging out. The style  is quite nice, more than just a casual jacket. Very nice attention to detail and finish. It has partial elastic waist bands, shoulder expansion pleats, 7 pockets!!! (3 inside with Velcro closure, (4) outside, 2 with zippers and 2 open for quick access.After seeing this jacket in person and wearing it, I ordered one in Brown.

London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Good As A Packable Jacket,4.0,"I needed a lightweight jacket that would pack well, had some rain resistance and would match up with a white shirt and black slacks (work attire).  Although not perfect, this London Fog fills the need pretty well.  It has sold well and has, at last glance, over 1700 reviews so lots of details are out there.  Here are my pros and cons:Pros:True to size fit. I am 5'11' and 190lbs. The fit is very comfortable and even has some room for light layering.Packs well and resists wrinkling.Lots of pockets, including three inside that secure with hook and loop fasteners.  Big enough to actually be useful.Bi-swing back provides a wide and comfortable range of movement.Quality workmanship throughout.Cons:Not a ""true"" black, I'd call it a dark, matte charcoal.  Close enough but could be better.Elastic around the waistband tends to cause the waist ride up with movement and stay there, giving a very ""blousy"" look.For the price, fit and workmanship the jacket is five stars.  The two ""cons"" knock it down one star."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Very comfortable soft everyday water resistant jacket made well.,4.0,"Feel inside is great..Very comfortable. The coat is not heavy in weight.  The XL fits around my 5-10 230LB belly. It is light- its a golf coat. For me, its good to 40-45°. But you can wear it inside like when at the store and not overheat.  The BEST part is the 2 ea. dual front pockets.  There are really 4 pockets on front.  2 have zipper closures so your phone doesn't fall out.,.the other 2 are good for your hands.  Also 2 inside breast pockets and 1 little pocket down low inside. The jacket does not restrict your motion- you really could use this golfing!They have elastic around waist-Good. The cuffs are button closures- too bad they have no elastic in the cuff.  I usually have to unsnap the cuffs to take off the coat past my hands. Then put the coat back on and snap the cuffs back. But once on, the cuffs feel good.Weak points  (1) Gray material  under collar.  Should be black like the coat..It is not seen when  collar is down as you would normally wear coat. (2) a bit of static electricity in material. I need to wash it with fabric softener or some other anti-static treatment.Wish list?

Being able to purchase it at a great discount on amazon (with quick delivery, I might add) was a great plus.There are four exterior pockets, one on top of the other on each side. The ""top"" pockets are zippered, which is a very nice feature, as I seem to use them a lot. No more having smaller items fall out. There are three interior pockets. Two are actually pretty spacious and are top open access, one left and one right, and secured with velco. The final, lower left side, has a flap, again with Velcro. And there have been times I have used all of them.The material is soft and feels good when wearing. The adjustable snap cuff is an added bonus. The jacket is well-made with good London Fog attention to detail. Two snaps on the sleeve to fit probably any size arm. Sometimes, I even unsnap them, depends on the look I want. As of this writing, my jacket looks exactly as pictured on amazon.Make no mistake. This is not for extreme winter wear. I bought it for spring and fall use, as well as the occasional crisp summer nights. It is perfect for that use. It has even kept me very dry in rain, including some pretty heavy downpours. The microfiber dries out fairly quickly. I have not had any issues with wrinkling.I am quite pleased with, and highly recommend, this jacket. So much so, that I also purchased one in black."

   I'm happy with my purchase. When I bought mine (from amazon.com), it was about $12 cheaper for some reason. Even at the current price, though (about $35), it's a good buy.Anyway, please see my video review.Oh, just for reference, I'm about 5'5"" = 165cm tall (or short, depending on how you view things)."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Great Fit For My Body Size,5.0,"Plenty of good things have already been said about this jacket which I agree with, so I won't bore you by repeating them here.  My only concern isn't about the product so much, but about how descriptive reviews concerning the fit often fail to describe the person that's wearing the jacket.  To say it's a ""great fit"", ""too long"", ""too tight,"" etc., is worthless unless the reader knows more about the wearer's body.  So here goes . . . I bought a Large size jacket.  I'm 5'10"", at 202 lbs, and have slightly long arms.  (A 34"" sleeve shirt sleeve ends the cuffs near perfectly, about 3/4 inch below my wrist.)  I mention this because this Large size jacket also fits my arm length perfectly, which might make the sleeves a smidgen long for men with more average length arms. (Probably not a big deal tho, as the cuff's snaps should stop the sleeves from sliding into your hand.)  Believe my shoulder and chest width is about average for my height, and the jacket fits well there too, with some jacket slack.  Am happy with the general length of this Large size, but (alas!) I've got a fairly significant gut which makes zipping the jacket a tight fit in that area, so, I'll likely just wear it unzipped, which is rarely a problem in Albuquerque's mostly warm temperatures.  Hope this more descriptive info provides some extra help in figuring out the best size for your order.  PS - Just have to add that the jacket really is a quality buy for the $$$ and ""free"" returns removes any real sizing anxiety."

   I bought this specifically for impersonating the Walter White character. I am a medium to slim  build guy, very average body type. This fits perfectly. The color is Camel. Washed and machine dried, no issues. Money well spent for the purpose I wanted it for.I'm 6'0"", 180 lbs. I take a 40 Long Sports coat or suit jacket. So you can see how this jacket fits me by comparison.UPDATE: Bought my third one, in black this time. Heisenberg - ""Breaking Bass"""
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Great price for the quality,5.0,"I was looking for a lightweight jacket for spring, fall and warmer winter days. I have lived in Boise, Id for 10 years and have not seen below zero yet.The jacket is very well made, no loose stitches or threads hanging out. The style  is quite nice, more than just a casual jacket. Very nice attention to detail and finish. It has partial elastic waist bands, shoulder expansion pleats, 7 pockets!!! (3 inside with Velcro closure, (4) outside, 2 with zippers and 2 open for quick access.After seeing this jacket in person and wearing it, I ordered one in Brown. I have spent money on things that were well below my expectations but, this jacket has far exceeded my expectations. I have included a pic of the inside of the jacket."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Good As A Packable Jacket,4.0,"I needed a lightweight jacket that would pack well, had some rain resistance and would match up with a white shirt and black slacks (work attire).  Although not perfect, this London Fog fills the need pretty well.  It has sold well and has, at last glance, over 1700 reviews so lots of details are out there.  Here are my pros and cons:Pros:True to size fit. I am 5'11' and 190lbs. The fit is very comfortable and even has some room for light layering.Packs well and resists wrinkling.Lots of pockets, including three inside that secure with hook and loop fasteners.  Big enough to actually be useful.Bi-swing back provides a wide and comfortable range of movement.Quality workmanship throughout.Cons:Not a ""true"" black, I'd call it a dark, matte charcoal.  Close enough but could be better.Elastic around the waistband tends to cause the waist ride up with movement and stay there, giving a very ""blousy"" look.For the price, fit and workmanship the jacket is five stars.  The two ""cons"" knock it down one star."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Very comfortable soft everyday water resistant jacket made well.,4.0,"Feel inside is great..Very comfortable. The coat is not heavy in weight.  The XL fits around my 5-10 230LB belly. It is light- its a golf coat. For me, its good to 40-45°. But you can wear it inside like when at the store and not overheat.  The BEST part is the 2 ea. dual front pockets.  There are really 4 pockets on front.  2 have zipper closures so your phone doesn't fall out.,.the other 2 are good for your hands.  Also 2 inside breast pockets and 1 little pocket down low inside. The jacket does not restrict your motion- you really could use this golfing!They have elastic around waist-Good. The cuffs are button closures- too bad they have no elastic in the cuff.  I usually have to unsnap the cuffs to take off the coat past my hands. Then put the coat back on and snap the cuffs back. But once on, the cuffs feel good.Weak points  (1) Gray material  under collar.  Should be black like the coat..It is not seen when  collar is down as you would normally wear coat. (2) a bit of static electricity in material. I need to wash it with fabric softener or some other anti-static treatment.Wish list? A little elastic in cuff and maybe a light weight water resistant  hood tucked into the collar. The microfiber outer is Water resistant."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Perfect But Pay Attention to the Sizing Comments,5.0,"First a BIG THANK YOU to all who wrote about the long sleeve length and fuller body fit. I am 6'3"", 230lbs with a 34"" waist and routinely wear an XL. Based on other's comments regarding the sleeves running long, I bought this in Large. It fits perfectly!! Plenty of great pockets, functional and well placed. The extra shoulder flexibility makes arm movement easier. The black I ordered sure looks as black as my other black coats.This is exactly the light weight jacket I was looking for.  I thought the price was great and could not be happier with the purchase."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Exactly the jacket I was looking for (once I got the right size),4.0,"I originally purchased a medium, because that's what I usually wear, but it fit more like a large.  So I returned it and purchased a small, and it fits perfectly.  This is a really nice jacket.  Not fussy.  Very soft and comfortable -- with plenty of pockets.  Besides two inside  pockets with velcro tabs, it also has an third inside pocket for cell phone or even a wallet, with a velco closure and a flap. Outside has four(!) pockets: two open ones to tuck your hands, and, inconspicuously behind them, two zippered ones for your stuff.  The jacket is not stiff at all.  It's a the right weight for spring or fall. Made in Vietnam."
London Fog Men's Auburn Zip-Front Golf Jacket (Regular & Big-Tall Sizes),Excellent light jacket,5.0,"In my area it's only really cold a few days of the year.  While I own several coats and jackets that keep me warm during those few times, they are too warm the rest of the time.  I needed something light, something to keep off a chill while holding off the wind and the occasional light mist.  Enter two great choices:  The London Fog Auburn Jacket and the Weatherproof Classic Golf Jacket.  Both jackets were available from Amazon at reduced prices so I bought both.  The bottom line is I like both and I'm keeping both.  Both are similar and both are winners.  My advice is to buy based on color and cost because you can't really lose.The Weatherproof Classic Golf Jacket differs from the Auburn Jacket by having knit cuffs and bottom edge.  The Auburn Jacket has elastic in the bottom edge and the cuffs snap closed.  I have no preference either way.  The outer fabric of both is microfiber polyester (whatever happened to poly/cotton twill, I wonder).  Both feel like the same weight and look like they could have been cut from the same bolts of cloth except for the colors.  The liners are a little different with the Weatherproof being slightly heavier but in no way bulky or thick.  The Auburn has a lighter feeling fabric inside.  Again, I have no preference either way.  Fit-wise they are very much alike.  The Weatherproof is a little longer in the body than the Auburn when the Auburn is bought in standard sizes.  Personally, I probably should have gotten the tall size of the Auburn but reviews indicated the Auburns sleeves are a bit too long and tall sizes usually have even longer sleeves.  I'm almost exactly six feet tall with a long torso so I can usually go either standard or tall without either seeming off.  I ordered the Auburn in standard length and it's okay but just a tad short.  However, I wouldn't want the sleeves to be any longer.  The Weatherproof fits me perfectly in length and the sleeves are okay too--not as long as those on the Auburn.  I ordered XXL in both jackets and I cannot detect any difference in the fit around the chest or waist.  They're roomy enough in my case for wearing a heavy sweater if need be.  I've worn them with thick sweatshirts but nothing heavier.I've worn both jackets in 45F weather but not in the rain.  Both cut the wind well.  I don't expect either to be waterproof like my Eddie Bauer rain parka.  Probably fine for a light mist or a quick shower.  What I find so great about these jackets is that they're comfortable over a wide range of temperatures.  I can wear one while driving without having to deal with the bulk of a heavier coat and I can wear it indoors for extended periods without feeling overheated.  Even on cold days, I usually only need a jacket for those times I'm outdoors between buildings or from the car to a building.  I only need a really warm coat when I'm outside for more than a few minutes.Which to buy?  Both are great.  I have a tan London Fog Auburn and a light blue Weatherproof Classic Golf.  Both colors will coordinate and match with other colors fine.  The London Fog has more color choices here on Amazon so that might be a factor.  My decision was made based on price.  At the time I bought both jackets, the prices were at a low point and both jackets were bargains.EDIT 01/18/2019:I've worn both these jackets for a while now and I have to give the edge to the London Fog.  That's based on a couple of things about the Weatherproof that wasn't evident at first.  Mainly it has to do with the knit cuffs on the Weatherproof.  In a very short time, they are beginning to pill on the right side of my jacket.  I'm not sure this speaks well for the quality of the fabric for the longterm.  Another thing I did not notice early on is that the cuffs on the Weatherproof do not match.  The left cuff's knit is different from the right.  This might explain the pilling of the right cuff.  However, I admit I like the way the knit cuffs fit compared to the snap cuffs of the London Fog.  On the London Fog, the cuffs feel either too tight or too loose, depending on which snap I use."

We've recently had temps well below zero for days (-20 or more with wind chills even lower), and I need something that can hold up to these temps.  This jacket does it!

Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Buyer beware.,1.0,"I received my Carhartt jacket yesterday (J140 in gravel) and almost immediately noticed a single 3 inch “vein” running up the right shoulder, it almost resembled a hard water stain. I washed the jacket according to Carhartts recommendation (gentle cycle, mild detergent, tumble dry, low heat).I removed the brand new jacket from the dryer and found these veins resembling hard water were now all over the jacket from the hood to the waistline! It looks like a stone wash or acid wash finish from the 80’s... it’s terrible.Carhartt was willing to inspect the jacket for defects, but stated that my size won’t be in stock for 9 months and offered no other solution.Ultimately if you’re buying this jacket for work the rugged construction will serve you well, if you’re buying this for it’s aesthetics and expect a new looking jacket you will be sorely disappointed.I’ve been screwed out of $109.00 and left with a jacket that looks as if it is 10 years old."

Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Buyer beware.,1.0,"I received my Carhartt jacket yesterday (J140 in gravel) and almost immediately noticed a single 3 inch “vein” running up the right shoulder, it almost resembled a hard water stain. I washed the jacket according to Carhartts recommendation (gentle cycle, mild detergent, tumble dry, low heat).I removed the brand new jacket from the dryer and found these veins resembling hard water were now all over the jacket from the hood to the waistline! It looks like a stone wash or acid wash finish from the 80’s... it’s terrible.Carhartt was willing to inspect the jacket for defects, but stated that my size won’t be in stock for 9 months and offered no other solution.Ultimately if you’re buying this jacket for work the rugged construction will serve you well, if you’re buying this for it’s aesthetics and expect a new looking jacket you will be sorely disappointed.I’ve been screwed out of $109.00 and left with a jacket that looks as if it is 10 years old."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,"Most awesome jacket, I've owned!",5.0,"Always loved Carhartt. This jacket is awesome when it comes to not just being comfortable, but also for warmth. The outer layer is made to seriously protect against the wind and that's half the winter battle. The inner layers while not super thick is perfect especially with the addition of a sweatshirt or basic long sleeve shirt against the cold. Been my favorite jacket for years. Definitely recommend everyone has one. Good for cool days up to including extremely cold days"
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,"Regarding fit, quality & shipping",4.0,"Fit: I am 5' 11"" and 165 pounds and got the large. It's a bit too big in the body but the sleeves are a tad short and I'd like it longer in the body so I'm re-ordering it in large long. I will update this review once I receive the large long.Quality: It's good Carhartt quality. It's a bit stiff and the zipper is so-so - I've had 3 Carhartt jackets and they could for sure improve their zippers. Their zippers seem beefy and durable but they don't work smoothly.Shipping: Slow shipping from DUNGAREES. I ordered it on December 26 and received it on January 4.Update: I received the large long and it's a better fit for me. The sleeves are not at all too long. The length does extend to cover up half of my butt which I don't mind. A medium long might work for my build as well but maybe wouldn't have room for layers underneath."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,"Great product, great price",5.0,"WOW, I had forgotten how great these Carhartt coats and jackets were!  A real quality product.  Heavy canvas, with a brass zipper that lasts and lasts.  This is a 'work' jacket, built to take a beating.  Heavily insulated, with great cuffs to keep that cold sucking wind out in the winter time.I wear an extra-large regular length outer coat, most of the time, so that's what I ordered.  Oh...not a good decision.  This coat is easily a small 2x or a super-large xl.  Rather than taking the trouble to return & ask for a smaller coat - I'll just keep this one.  It's a winter coat, so the extra room might come in handy....  AND the price!  GREAT!"

Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,"Absolutely ginormous, not made for fit or average build people.",3.0,"Way too big! When they say “true to size” they must mean for people who are on the heavier side. I wear an XL in everything (I’m 6’1”, 207lbs), and have since I was in high school. I am relatively fit ie, no belly, and this thing in an XL can fit two of me, literally. The length is extremely long. I ordered an XL the first time, then a Large Tall, which was STILL too big. So I order a medium tall and it was STILL too big. I feel like a Small Tall would work for me, but after having to make 3 trips to amazon books to return, I’m over it. I literally haven’t worn a small anything since elementary school. So if you’re not overweight, have an extremely large build or looking to layer this with multiple sweaters underneath, this is NOT the jacket for you."

I am a working man and love all the T-shirts I have from Carhartt in large. Sure they are a little larger than a typical t-shirt but that gives you room to really move around and WORK. I went a size down for this and I suppose it fits fashion for how a jacket should fit but it doesn't cover my ass, which would be nice in the cold."

It's a bit too big in the body but the sleeves are a tad short and I'd like it longer in the body so I'm re-ordering it in large long. I will update this review once I receive the large long.Quality: It's good Carhartt quality. It's a bit stiff and the zipper is so-so - I've had 3 Carhartt jackets and they could for sure improve their zippers. Their zippers seem beefy and durable but they don't work smoothly.Shipping: Slow shipping from DUNGAREES. I ordered it on December 26 and received it on January 4.Update: I received the large long and it's a better fit for me. The sleeves are not at all too long. The length does extend to cover up half of my butt which I don't mind. A medium long might work for my build as well but maybe wouldn't have room for layers underneath."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,"Great product, great price",5.0,"WOW, I had forgotten how great these Carhartt coats and jackets were!  A real quality product.  Heavy canvas, with a brass zipper that lasts and lasts.  This is a 'work' jacket, built to take a beating.  Heavily insulated, with great cuffs to keep that cold sucking wind out in the winter time.I wear an extra-large regular length outer coat, most of the time, so that's what I ordered.  Oh...not a good decision.  This coat is easily a small 2x or a super-large xl.  Rather than taking the trouble to return & ask for a smaller coat - I'll just keep this one.  It's a winter coat, so the extra room might come in handy....  AND the price!  GREAT!"

Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,"Absolutely ginormous, not made for fit or average build people.",3.0,"Way too big! When they say “true to size” they must mean for people who are on the heavier side. I wear an XL in everything (I’m 6’1”, 207lbs), and have since I was in high school. I am relatively fit ie, no belly, and this thing in an XL can fit two of me, literally. The length is extremely long. I ordered an XL the first time, then a Large Tall, which was STILL too big. So I order a medium tall and it was STILL too big. I feel like a Small Tall would work for me, but after having to make 3 trips to amazon books to return, I’m over it. I literally haven’t worn a small anything since elementary school. So if you’re not overweight, have an extremely large build or looking to layer this with multiple sweaters underneath, this is NOT the jacket for you."

I am 5'7 230 and 2XL was M A S S I V E, baggy at the bottom, baggy at the cuffs, but bunched up in the shoulders. All other 2XL Carhartt clothing fits me great, but this jacket in 2X does not. I exchanged my 2XL for a 1XL Tall, and it is the perfect length, my shoulder area is not bunched up, cuffs and bottom of jacket are just right, no drafts like with the 2x.Agree with all the other reviews as far as build quality/feel/insulative qualities of the jacket.

Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Size Review,5.0,"I went a size down like a lot of people recommend. It fits fine but I would have fine been getting my regular size as well. I think a lot of people are ordering this as a fashion piece and have never wore Carhartt before. Hence all the complaints and confusion about sizing. I am a working man and love all the T-shirts I have from Carhartt in large. Sure they are a little larger than a typical t-shirt but that gives you room to really move around and WORK. I went a size down for this and I suppose it fits fashion for how a jacket should fit but it doesn't cover my ass, which would be nice in the cold."

Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,This is a winter weather tamer!,5.0,"After reading several reviews, and then finally trying one on in store before purchasing, I knew I needed to order a size smaller than I typically would.  I've worn a black jacket with my work logo on it for several years and the long, cold, ND winters made me want something other than black for my daily wear jacket.  We've recently had temps well below zero for days (-20 or more with wind chills even lower), and I need something that can hold up to these temps.  This jacket does it!  It's a bit stiff at first but I have no doubt it will soften up over time.  The color is a great shade of red and it's very comfortable.  In typical Carhartt fashion, I expect to last for years."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Buyer beware.,1.0,"I received my Carhartt jacket yesterday (J140 in gravel) and almost immediately noticed a single 3 inch “vein” running up the right shoulder, it almost resembled a hard water stain. I washed the jacket according to Carhartts recommendation (gentle cycle, mild detergent, tumble dry, low heat).I removed the brand new jacket from the dryer and found these veins resembling hard water were now all over the jacket from the hood to the waistline! It looks like a stone wash or acid wash finish from the 80’s... it’s terrible.Carhartt was willing to inspect the jacket for defects, but stated that my size won’t be in stock for 9 months and offered no other solution.Ultimately if you’re buying this jacket for work the rugged construction will serve you well, if you’re buying this for it’s aesthetics and expect a new looking jacket you will be sorely disappointed.I’ve been screwed out of $109.00 and left with a jacket that looks as if it is 10 years old."

Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,"Absolutely ginormous, not made for fit or average build people.",3.0,"Way too big! When they say “true to size” they must mean for people who are on the heavier side. I wear an XL in everything (I’m 6’1”, 207lbs), and have since I was in high school.

So I order a medium tall and it was STILL too big. I feel like a Small Tall would work for me, but after having to make 3 trips to amazon books to return, I’m over it. I literally haven’t worn a small anything since elementary school.

Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,Size Review,5.0,"I went a size down like a lot of people recommend. It fits fine but I would have fine been getting my regular size as well. I think a lot of people are ordering this as a fashion piece and have never wore Carhartt before. Hence all the complaints and confusion about sizing. I am a working man and love all the T-shirts I have from Carhartt in large. Sure they are a little larger than a typical t-shirt but that gives you room to really move around and WORK. I went a size down for this and I suppose it fits fashion for how a jacket should fit but it doesn't cover my ass, which would be nice in the cold."

I've worn a black jacket with my work logo on it for several years and the long, cold, ND winters made me want something other than black for my daily wear jacket.  We've recently had temps well below zero for days (-20 or more with wind chills even lower), and I need something that can hold up to these temps.  This jacket does it!  It's a bit stiff at first but I have no doubt it will soften up over time.  The color is a great shade of red and it's very comfortable.  In typical Carhartt fashion, I expect to last for years."

It looks like a stone wash or acid wash finish from the 80’s... it’s terrible.Carhartt was willing to inspect the jacket for defects, but stated that my size won’t be in stock for 9 months and offered no other solution.Ultimately if you’re buying this jacket for work the rugged construction will serve you well, if you’re buying this for it’s aesthetics and expect a new looking jacket you will be sorely disappointed.I’ve been screwed out of $109.00 and left with a jacket that looks as if it is 10 years old."
Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined Duck Active Jacket,"Most awesome jacket, I've owned!",5.0,"Always loved Carhartt. This jacket is awesome when it comes to not just being comfortable, but also for warmth. The outer layer is made to seriously protect against the wind and that's half the winter battle.

It's a bit stiff and the zipper is so-so - I've had 3 Carhartt jackets and they could for sure improve their zippers.

Homaok Men's Lightweight Breathable Jacket,Dont waste your money,1.0,"The material is wack , the material is like plastic"
Homaok Men's Lightweight Breathable Jacket,"I am about 5'11 and i believe i'm all most 170lbs and a medium fit me perfect, i love the jacket i love the material",5.0,"the jacket was a day late, but i expected that, from reading these reviews prior to buying it i was skeptic toward purchasing it because of size complications and the possibility that the material would be uncomfortable or too thin, I am about 5'11 and i believe i'm all most 170lbs and a medium fit me perfect, i love the jacket i love the material, and everybody else around me loves it, it was a great buy and i will be buying more colors..........I hope my review helped.......but side note, its pretty hard to scrape the color off the jacket but if it rubs up against a rough surface with some pressure it will scratch the color off, but believe me you[d really have to be trying to apply pressure to that surface, the zipper is great and the hood is very proportionate for my big head and long hair."
Homaok Men's Lightweight Breathable Jacket,JUST BE AWARE,2.0,"Don’t get me wrong. This is a stylish jacket that’s fits the urban millennial style of 2019. Only problem with this product is that it was way smaller than their other jackets. I bought two of the same jackets just different colors both at LARGE. The green one fits like a large but the navy blue one fits like a medium. Both jackets are made from different material and have different zipper styles. So depending on what color you choose you will get a different material and size from the posted size you selected. Also on my green jacket, the zipper got stuck and won’t open but I can zip it up and put it on but can’t un zip it fully"
Homaok Men's Lightweight Breathable Jacket,"Here's what you need to know about ""dark red"" jacket",2.0,"I agree with several reviews in respect to the length of this jacket: I bought Large size and what I got is by no means that size. It is way too short!Another issue, the color: it is not ""dark red"" that the seller shows in the picture/photo of it.  It's much brighter red.  Not as much as the ""red"" one, but still, not even close to what the seller advertises in the photos of this ""dark red"" jacket.I like the material, it's always matter of taste and personal ""liking"" or not liking.But here's one more thing: wake up and smell the coffee, Homaok: it's year 2020 and we have smart phones we need to carry in our jackets.  Your pockets not only have no zipper or a snap to make sure they don't fall out of these pockets, these pockets are just way too shallow to hold many of smart phones we have.I do not recommend this product."
Homaok Men's Lightweight Breathable Jacket,Trash,1.0,Wretched piece of trash.  First of all the label said XXL I ordered a small (I checked) and it appeared the size of a small.  The material was thinner than bible paper.  The zipper was completely broken.  Returned.
Homaok Men's Lightweight Breathable Jacket,KNOW HOW YOU WANT IT TO FIT!!,5.0,"As a general rule of thumb for any clothing that is manufactured overseas, you need to know how you want it to fit and the size you need based on your area. Mine fit great so I'm not complaining, just a warning. I bought this about 2 years ago and they are great quality compared to some of the other products I've gotten overseas. The material is very thin and not very breathable but if you wear it over a t-shirt it won't stick to your skin and make you sweat. It's very stylish too, would definitely recommend."
Homaok Men's Lightweight Breathable Jacket,good price; good jacket *thumbs up*,4.0,"the quality is pretty nice and incredibly soft. the color is really good and the price for it is really good. dont zip with this jacket it just doesn't work (as a style not the zipper by the way). another thing, don't wear it when it's raining and never mix colors with this jacket. You'll ruin the jacket if you mix and colors (trust me I have). The color is really white and well done so if you mix it with any by accident or whatsoever it'll ruin it.tldr; good jacket go get it."

Homaok Men's Lightweight Breathable Jacket,JUST BE AWARE,2.0,"Don’t get me wrong. This is a stylish jacket that’s fits the urban millennial style of 2019. Only problem with this product is that it was way smaller than their other jackets. I bought two of the same jackets just different colors both at LARGE. The green one fits like a large but the navy blue one fits like a medium. Both jackets are made from different material and have different zipper styles. So depending on what color you choose you will get a different material and size from the posted size you selected. Also on my green jacket, the zipper got stuck and won’t open but I can zip it up and put it on but can’t un zip it fully"
Homaok Men's Lightweight Breathable Jacket,"Here's what you need to know about ""dark red"" jacket",2.0,"I agree with several reviews in respect to the length of this jacket: I bought Large size and what I got is by no means that size. It is way too short!Another issue, the color: it is not ""dark red"" that the seller shows in the picture/photo of it.  It's much brighter red.  Not as much as the ""red"" one, but still, not even close to what the seller advertises in the photos of this ""dark red"" jacket.I like the material, it's always matter of taste and personal ""liking"" or not liking.But here's one more thing: wake up and smell the coffee, Homaok: it's year 2020 and we have smart phones we need to carry in our jackets.  Your pockets not only have no zipper or a snap to make sure they don't fall out of these pockets, these pockets are just way too shallow to hold many of smart phones we have.I do not recommend this product."

Homaok Men's Lightweight Breathable Jacket,KNOW HOW YOU WANT IT TO FIT!!,5.0,"As a general rule of thumb for any clothing that is manufactured overseas, you need to know how you want it to fit and the size you need based on your area. Mine fit great so I'm not complaining, just a warning. I bought this about 2 years ago and they are great quality compared to some of the other products I've gotten overseas. The material is very thin and not very breathable but if you wear it over a t-shirt it won't stick to your skin and make you sweat. It's very stylish too, would definitely recommend."

You'll ruin the jacket if you mix and colors (trust me I have). The color is really white and well done so if you mix it with any by accident or whatsoever it'll ruin it.tldr; good jacket go get it."

Homaok Men's Lightweight Breathable Jacket,JUST BE AWARE,2.0,"Don’t get me wrong. This is a stylish jacket that’s fits the urban millennial style of 2019. Only problem with this product is that it was way smaller than their other jackets. I bought two of the same jackets just different colors both at LARGE. The green one fits like a large but the navy blue one fits like a medium. Both jackets are made from different material and have different zipper styles. So depending on what color you choose you will get a different material and size from the posted size you selected. Also on my green jacket, the zipper got stuck and won’t open but I can zip it up and put it on but can’t un zip it fully"

Not as much as the ""red"" one, but still, not even close to what the seller advertises in the photos of this ""dark red"" jacket.I like the material, it's always matter of taste and personal ""liking"" or not liking.But here's one more thing: wake up and smell the coffee, Homaok: it's year 2020 and we have smart phones we need to carry in our jackets.  Your pockets not only have no zipper or a snap to make sure they don't fall out of these pockets, these pockets are just way too shallow to hold many of smart phones we have.I do not recommend this product."

Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Perfect base layer,5.0,Exactly what I was looking for. I was looking for a water resistant light weight and warm base layer.

This version is a little bit more tough and rough it seems.  I was able to pack it in the bag it came along with.  I'm 150lb 5'6 and got a Small.  As you can see in the pictures it fits fine, the chest portion is a little snug as I wear a 38 jacket.  The waist portion has a lot of room left.  Two pockets on the outside and two on the inside.  I still have to try out during a colder night, but I think it'll get the job done!"
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Versatile light-mid weight jacket - perfect for multi-uses,5.0,"It's impossible to find anything I don't like about this jacket.  I'm completely surprised - especially because of the low cost.  I was not expecting this level of quality, look and feel.  I wanted a light weight jacket that could be layer under and especially for travel where space and weight is a concern and I didn't want to pay a lot of money for it.  I looked at a LOT of jackets and they were either too warm, too bulky or too cheaply made based on reviews.  And then I found this incredible jacket.It exceeded my expectations in all categories.  I would say the temp range is from 20-45 degrees with fairly minimal layering/under garments, but that will depend on just what you wear underneath.  It definitely does a nice job of breaking the wind, so with fleece underneath, it could be toasty at 15 degrees.  It's extremely comfortable - it barely feels like you are wearing a jacket at all.  I'm 6'1"" with a 42"" chest, 180 lbs, and a large fits perfectly with sufficient space for movement and a layer or two.  The length is perfect at just below the waist and the sleeve length perfect - I wear a 36"" sleeve.  As others have mentioned the collar does not turn down, but it is a pretty minimal collar and with this soft material, I find I really like the collar the way it is.  The material is soft and pliable and never feels stiff and uncomfortable.  I bought the Heather Green and it's really a nice color that has a great casual look and it's not that shiny look - it's kinda matte type finish.  I've gotten a lot of complements on it.  And when I tell people what I paid they are blown away.The jacket has two large lined and very deep exterior side pockets that zip and one large interior vest pocket that does not zip or close which is fine by me.  Velcro would have been annoying.  And finally, it comes with a separate bag with a draw string that secures the jacket when rolled up.  And the bag can attach to the inside coat hanger loop if you desire, which is how it came and the way I use it.  The water resistant feature is nice for drizzle and mist, but I'll wear it underneath a waterproof windbreaker in rainy conditions.  This will become my go to travel jacket.This is indeed a home run for Amazon Basics and I highly recommend this jacket."

Tested this jacket in the low 40’s in windy and rainy weather with just a long sleeve running shirt underneath. Toasty warm. Compares very favorably with a TNF Thermoball jacket I have, and I actually think this Amazon jacket is warmer. Seems to be solid construction. Can’t go wrong for $39."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,This Jacket is perfect,5.0,"I bought this jacket for my son last minute for a trip out of state.  I needed something fast as it was going to be very cold and all he had was a windbreaker/shell and sweatshirts.  Jacket came quickly and was perfect.  I ordered a large, he is 6'3, thin build and it fit him in the sleeves and body.  The length was great too.  The length was most likely such a good fit for his height due to him being very slender.  So if you are shorter but thicker the large would probably fit.  He wore the jacket the whole time over a sweatshirt and it kept him warm.  It is a basic no frills very plain jacket.  Just what he likes, no labels, bells or whistles.  At this price point you can not go wrong.  I ordered the black and it looked much like my Patagonia jacket.  Amazon basics does it again for me!"

My friends have all been blown away by the light weight, & here in the San Francisco Bay Area it's all the jacket I need. The medium size fits me perfectly ( 5'10"", 180 pounds) & layers perfectly over a hoody if I need extra warmth. My only complaint, & it's a very tiny one, is that I wish one of the inside pockets were a little smaller. But, sized as they are, I can fit my pocket umbrella into one & my beanie cap into the other. When packed into its stuff sack it fits nicely into my backpack & I can leave it there for long periods, pull it back out, & it's ready to wear. I wear it all the time, there's been no sign of defects, & I love this jacket so much I'm likely going to order another in a different color. If your area's winters are really cold you'll likely want a heavier jacket, but if you live on the California coast you probably don't need anything heavier than this. Highly recommended, especially at this price!!!"
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Reliable Casual Jacket,4.0,"It's lightweight, seems well constructed and is reliable. I've worn it in temperatures as low as 13 degrees fahrenheit and it kept me warm. It's not one of those high-end down puffer jackets, but if you're looking for a lightweight jacket for being out and about in cold weather, this is solid. I've also heard of people stowing this jacket in its pack in their cars for emergencies, which is a great idea too."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Good jacket for the money,4.0,"Looks good and is breathable, but will still keep you warm. They must have fitted this for a square person with a big belly though. The bottom flares out for anyone with a beer belly lol. On a lighter note, it is still a good product and my favorite thing about this jacket is how comfortable it is. 4 stars. Btw I am 6’3 at 205 and athletic and I bought the XL. A large would probably fit my body better overall but probably be too short and ride up at my waistUpdate:I ordered the large to see if it fit better and it was in fact too small in the shoulders and only went down to my belt buckle. Dang, right in between sizes. Oh well, I’m returning the large and keeping the XL. There is such a difference between the two sizes that I think my XL may just have been improperly measured when made and that’s why the belly sticks out; or maybe they just figured anyone bigger than a size large probably has a beer belly and accommodated lol. Still 4 stars for the price and comfort. I think the only reason I’m making a big deal about it is because my girlfriend gave me a hard time about my apparent beer belly and I’m hung up on it. Anyhoo, plenty of room to grow so pass me a Guinness ;)"

It’s light but surprisingly warm and with my rain jacket over it, I’ve never had even a chill. It comes with a little bag so it must scrunch up quite small although I’ve yet to attempt it. And a word about sizing. I usually buy a large, but after reading a number of reviews here, I decided to take their advice and go one size down. To all of you who suggested that, a big thank you.

Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,This Jacket is perfect,5.0,"I bought this jacket for my son last minute for a trip out of state.  I needed something fast as it was going to be very cold and all he had was a windbreaker/shell and sweatshirts.  Jacket came quickly and was perfect.  I ordered a large, he is 6'3, thin build and it fit him in the sleeves and body.  The length was great too.  The length was most likely such a good fit for his height due to him being very slender.  So if you are shorter but thicker the large would probably fit.  He wore the jacket the whole time over a sweatshirt and it kept him warm.  It is a basic no frills very plain jacket.

Dang, right in between sizes. Oh well, I’m returning the large and keeping the XL. There is such a difference between the two sizes that I think my XL may just have been improperly measured when made and that’s why the belly sticks out; or maybe they just figured anyone bigger than a size large probably has a beer belly and accommodated lol. Still 4 stars for the price and comfort. I think the only reason I’m making a big deal about it is because my girlfriend gave me a hard time about my apparent beer belly and I’m hung up on it.

Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Versatile light-mid weight jacket - perfect for multi-uses,5.0,"It's impossible to find anything I don't like about this jacket.  I'm completely surprised - especially because of the low cost.  I was not expecting this level of quality, look and feel.  I wanted a light weight jacket that could be layer under and especially for travel where space and weight is a concern and I didn't want to pay a lot of money for it.  I looked at a LOT of jackets and they were either too warm, too bulky or too cheaply made based on reviews.  And then I found this incredible jacket.It exceeded my expectations in all categories.  I would say the temp range is from 20-45 degrees with fairly minimal layering/under garments, but that will depend on just what you wear underneath.  It definitely does a nice job of breaking the wind, so with fleece underneath, it could be toasty at 15 degrees.  It's extremely comfortable - it barely feels like you are wearing a jacket at all.  I'm 6'1"" with a 42"" chest, 180 lbs, and a large fits perfectly with sufficient space for movement and a layer or two.  The length is perfect at just below the waist and the sleeve length perfect - I wear a 36"" sleeve.  As others have mentioned the collar does not turn down, but it is a pretty minimal collar and with this soft material, I find I really like the collar the way it is.  The material is soft and pliable and never feels stiff and uncomfortable.  I bought the Heather Green and it's really a nice color that has a great casual look and it's not that shiny look - it's kinda matte type finish.  I've gotten a lot of complements on it.  And when I tell people what I paid they are blown away.The jacket has two large lined and very deep exterior side pockets that zip and one large interior vest pocket that does not zip or close which is fine by me.  Velcro would have been annoying.  And finally, it comes with a separate bag with a draw string that secures the jacket when rolled up.  And the bag can attach to the inside coat hanger loop if you desire, which is how it came and the way I use it.  The water resistant feature is nice for drizzle and mist, but I'll wear it underneath a waterproof windbreaker in rainy conditions.  This will become my go to travel jacket.This is indeed a home run for Amazon Basics and I highly recommend this jacket."

If I was exploring Alaska or Northern Europe, then I would feel differently, but I’m not so I try and keep the expenses under control.I purchased this jacket on a whim and I’m quite happy with it. It’s light but surprisingly warm and with my rain jacket over it, I’ve never had even a chill. It comes with a little bag so it must scrunch up quite small although I’ve yet to attempt it. And a word about sizing. I usually buy a large, but after reading a number of reviews here, I decided to take their advice and go one size down. To all of you who suggested that, a big thank you. It fits perfect!"

Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Nice fit but still have to try out,4.0,"For the price I had to try.  I have an REI version of this jacket.  This version is a little bit more tough and rough it seems.  I was able to pack it in the bag it came along with.  I'm 150lb 5'6 and got a Small.  As you can see in the pictures it fits fine, the chest portion is a little snug as I wear a 38 jacket.  The waist portion has a lot of room left.  Two pockets on the outside and two on the inside.

Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Versatile light-mid weight jacket - perfect for multi-uses,5.0,"It's impossible to find anything I don't like about this jacket.  I'm completely surprised - especially because of the low cost.  I was not expecting this level of quality, look and feel.  I wanted a light weight jacket that could be layer under and especially for travel where space and weight is a concern and I didn't want to pay a lot of money for it.  I looked at a LOT of jackets and they were either too warm, too bulky or too cheaply made based on reviews.  And then I found this incredible jacket.It exceeded my expectations in all categories.  I would say the temp range is from 20-45 degrees with fairly minimal layering/under garments, but that will depend on just what you wear underneath.  It definitely does a nice job of breaking the wind, so with fleece underneath, it could be toasty at 15 degrees.  It's extremely comfortable - it barely feels like you are wearing a jacket at all.  I'm 6'1"" with a 42"" chest, 180 lbs, and a large fits perfectly with sufficient space for movement and a layer or two.  The length is perfect at just below the waist and the sleeve length perfect - I wear a 36"" sleeve.  As others have mentioned the collar does not turn down, but it is a pretty minimal collar and with this soft material, I find I really like the collar the way it is.  The material is soft and pliable and never feels stiff and uncomfortable.  I bought the Heather Green and it's really a nice color that has a great casual look and it's not that shiny look - it's kinda matte type finish.  I've gotten a lot of complements on it.  And when I tell people what I paid they are blown away.The jacket has two large lined and very deep exterior side pockets that zip and one large interior vest pocket that does not zip or close which is fine by me.  Velcro would have been annoying.  And finally, it comes with a separate bag with a draw string that secures the jacket when rolled up.  And the bag can attach to the inside coat hanger loop if you desire, which is how it came and the way I use it.  The water resistant feature is nice for drizzle and mist, but I'll wear it underneath a waterproof windbreaker in rainy conditions.  This will become my go to travel jacket.This is indeed a home run for Amazon Basics and I highly recommend this jacket."

Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,This Jacket is perfect,5.0,"I bought this jacket for my son last minute for a trip out of state.  I needed something fast as it was going to be very cold and all he had was a windbreaker/shell and sweatshirts.  Jacket came quickly and was perfect.  I ordered a large, he is 6'3, thin build and it fit him in the sleeves and body.  The length was great too.  The length was most likely such a good fit for his height due to him being very slender.  So if you are shorter but thicker the large would probably fit.  He wore the jacket the whole time over a sweatshirt and it kept him warm.  It is a basic no frills very plain jacket.  Just what he likes, no labels, bells or whistles.  At this price point you can not go wrong.  I ordered the black and it looked much like my Patagonia jacket.  Amazon basics does it again for me!"

My friends have all been blown away by the light weight, & here in the San Francisco Bay Area it's all the jacket I need. The medium size fits me perfectly ( 5'10"", 180 pounds) & layers perfectly over a hoody if I need extra warmth. My only complaint, & it's a very tiny one, is that I wish one of the inside pockets were a little smaller. But, sized as they are, I can fit my pocket umbrella into one & my beanie cap into the other. When packed into its stuff sack it fits nicely into my backpack & I can leave it there for long periods, pull it back out, & it's ready to wear.

They must have fitted this for a square person with a big belly though. The bottom flares out for anyone with a beer belly lol. On a lighter note, it is still a good product and my favorite thing about this jacket is how comfortable it is. 4 stars. Btw I am 6’3 at 205 and athletic and I bought the XL. A large would probably fit my body better overall but probably be too short and ride up at my waistUpdate:I ordered the large to see if it fit better and it was in fact too small in the shoulders and only went down to my belt buckle. Dang, right in between sizes. Oh well, I’m returning the large and keeping the XL. There is such a difference between the two sizes that I think my XL may just have been improperly measured when made and that’s why the belly sticks out; or maybe they just figured anyone bigger than a size large probably has a beer belly and accommodated lol. Still 4 stars for the price and comfort. I think the only reason I’m making a big deal about it is because my girlfriend gave me a hard time about my apparent beer belly and I’m hung up on it.

I ordered a large, he is 6'3, thin build and it fit him in the sleeves and body.  The length was great too.  The length was most likely such a good fit for his height due to him being very slender.  So if you are shorter but thicker the large would probably fit.  He wore the jacket the whole time over a sweatshirt and it kept him warm.  It is a basic no frills very plain jacket.  Just what he likes, no labels, bells or whistles.  At this price point you can not go wrong.  I ordered the black and it looked much like my Patagonia jacket.  Amazon basics does it again for me!"

My friends have all been blown away by the light weight, & here in the San Francisco Bay Area it's all the jacket I need. The medium size fits me perfectly ( 5'10"", 180 pounds) & layers perfectly over a hoody if I need extra warmth. My only complaint, & it's a very tiny one, is that I wish one of the inside pockets were a little smaller.

Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Good jacket for the money,4.0,"Looks good and is breathable, but will still keep you warm. They must have fitted this for a square person with a big belly though. The bottom flares out for anyone with a beer belly lol. On a lighter note, it is still a good product and my favorite thing about this jacket is how comfortable it is. 4 stars. Btw I am 6’3 at 205 and athletic and I bought the XL. A large would probably fit my body better overall but probably be too short and ride up at my waistUpdate:I ordered the large to see if it fit better and it was in fact too small in the shoulders and only went down to my belt buckle. Dang, right in between sizes. Oh well, I’m returning the large and keeping the XL. There is such a difference between the two sizes that I think my XL may just have been improperly measured when made and that’s why the belly sticks out; or maybe they just figured anyone bigger than a size large probably has a beer belly and accommodated lol. Still 4 stars for the price and comfort. I think the only reason I’m making a big deal about it is because my girlfriend gave me a hard time about my apparent beer belly and I’m hung up on it.

Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Versatile light-mid weight jacket - perfect for multi-uses,5.0,"It's impossible to find anything I don't like about this jacket.  I'm completely surprised - especially because of the low cost.  I was not expecting this level of quality, look and feel.  I wanted a light weight jacket that could be layer under and especially for travel where space and weight is a concern and I didn't want to pay a lot of money for it.  I looked at a LOT of jackets and they were either too warm, too bulky or too cheaply made based on reviews.  And then I found this incredible jacket.It exceeded my expectations in all categories.  I would say the temp range is from 20-45 degrees with fairly minimal layering/under garments, but that will depend on just what you wear underneath.  It definitely does a nice job of breaking the wind, so with fleece underneath, it could be toasty at 15 degrees.  It's extremely comfortable - it barely feels like you are wearing a jacket at all.  I'm 6'1"" with a 42"" chest, 180 lbs, and a large fits perfectly with sufficient space for movement and a layer or two.  The length is perfect at just below the waist and the sleeve length perfect - I wear a 36"" sleeve.  As others have mentioned the collar does not turn down, but it is a pretty minimal collar and with this soft material, I find I really like the collar the way it is.  The material is soft and pliable and never feels stiff and uncomfortable.  I bought the Heather Green and it's really a nice color that has a great casual look and it's not that shiny look - it's kinda matte type finish.  I've gotten a lot of complements on it.  And when I tell people what I paid they are blown away.The jacket has two large lined and very deep exterior side pockets that zip and one large interior vest pocket that does not zip or close which is fine by me.  Velcro would have been annoying.  And finally, it comes with a separate bag with a draw string that secures the jacket when rolled up.  And the bag can attach to the inside coat hanger loop if you desire, which is how it came and the way I use it.  The water resistant feature is nice for drizzle and mist, but I'll wear it underneath a waterproof windbreaker in rainy conditions.  This will become my go to travel jacket.This is indeed a home run for Amazon Basics and I highly recommend this jacket."

Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Perfect base layer,5.0,Exactly what I was looking for. I was looking for a water resistant light weight and warm base layer. This one fits great. 2 deep internal pockets. Zippers on external pockets. Well constructed. No issues so far. I plan to scotch guard it just to ensure its water resistant.Ordered Size Large.5ft 6200lbs
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Nice fit but still have to try out,4.0,"For the price I had to try.  I have an REI version of this jacket.  This version is a little bit more tough and rough it seems.  I was able to pack it in the bag it came along with.  I'm 150lb 5'6 and got a Small.  As you can see in the pictures it fits fine, the chest portion is a little snug as I wear a 38 jacket.  The waist portion has a lot of room left.  Two pockets on the outside and two on the inside.  I still have to try out during a colder night, but I think it'll get the job done!"
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Versatile light-mid weight jacket - perfect for multi-uses,5.0,"It's impossible to find anything I don't like about this jacket.  I'm completely surprised - especially because of the low cost.  I was not expecting this level of quality, look and feel.  I wanted a light weight jacket that could be layer under and especially for travel where space and weight is a concern and I didn't want to pay a lot of money for it.  I looked at a LOT of jackets and they were either too warm, too bulky or too cheaply made based on reviews.  And then I found this incredible jacket.It exceeded my expectations in all categories.  I would say the temp range is from 20-45 degrees with fairly minimal layering/under garments, but that will depend on just what you wear underneath.  It definitely does a nice job of breaking the wind, so with fleece underneath, it could be toasty at 15 degrees.  It's extremely comfortable - it barely feels like you are wearing a jacket at all.  I'm 6'1"" with a 42"" chest, 180 lbs, and a large fits perfectly with sufficient space for movement and a layer or two.  The length is perfect at just below the waist and the sleeve length perfect - I wear a 36"" sleeve.  As others have mentioned the collar does not turn down, but it is a pretty minimal collar and with this soft material, I find I really like the collar the way it is.  The material is soft and pliable and never feels stiff and uncomfortable.  I bought the Heather Green and it's really a nice color that has a great casual look and it's not that shiny look - it's kinda matte type finish.  I've gotten a lot of complements on it.  And when I tell people what I paid they are blown away.The jacket has two large lined and very deep exterior side pockets that zip and one large interior vest pocket that does not zip or close which is fine by me.  Velcro would have been annoying.  And finally, it comes with a separate bag with a draw string that secures the jacket when rolled up.  And the bag can attach to the inside coat hanger loop if you desire, which is how it came and the way I use it.  The water resistant feature is nice for drizzle and mist, but I'll wear it underneath a waterproof windbreaker in rainy conditions.  This will become my go to travel jacket.This is indeed a home run for Amazon Basics and I highly recommend this jacket."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Solid jacket. On par with name brands for significantly less.,5.0,"Live in Georgia, so don’t need a blizzard proof jacket. Tested this jacket in the low 40’s in windy and rainy weather with just a long sleeve running shirt underneath. Toasty warm. Compares very favorably with a TNF Thermoball jacket I have, and I actually think this Amazon jacket is warmer. Seems to be solid construction. Can’t go wrong for $39."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,This Jacket is perfect,5.0,"I bought this jacket for my son last minute for a trip out of state.  I needed something fast as it was going to be very cold and all he had was a windbreaker/shell and sweatshirts.  Jacket came quickly and was perfect.  I ordered a large, he is 6'3, thin build and it fit him in the sleeves and body.  The length was great too.  The length was most likely such a good fit for his height due to him being very slender.  So if you are shorter but thicker the large would probably fit.  He wore the jacket the whole time over a sweatshirt and it kept him warm.  It is a basic no frills very plain jacket.  Just what he likes, no labels, bells or whistles.  At this price point you can not go wrong.  I ordered the black and it looked much like my Patagonia jacket.  Amazon basics does it again for me!"
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,it actually fits,5.0,"I stand 6'2"" weigh 200 pounds.  with 35 inch arms I have to wear xxl for the sleeves.  this fits perfectly, you will probably not wear this in Chicago on state street in February but if you live in san Francisco you will probably wear it year round.  as with amazon basic it's well made."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,"Loving It So Far, We'll See In A Month Or So",5.0,"I ordered this jacket more than a year ago, & so far it's been the best $40 I've ever spent on any single article of clothing. My friends have all been blown away by the light weight, & here in the San Francisco Bay Area it's all the jacket I need. The medium size fits me perfectly ( 5'10"", 180 pounds) & layers perfectly over a hoody if I need extra warmth. My only complaint, & it's a very tiny one, is that I wish one of the inside pockets were a little smaller. But, sized as they are, I can fit my pocket umbrella into one & my beanie cap into the other. When packed into its stuff sack it fits nicely into my backpack & I can leave it there for long periods, pull it back out, & it's ready to wear. I wear it all the time, there's been no sign of defects, & I love this jacket so much I'm likely going to order another in a different color. If your area's winters are really cold you'll likely want a heavier jacket, but if you live on the California coast you probably don't need anything heavier than this. Highly recommended, especially at this price!!!"
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Reliable Casual Jacket,4.0,"It's lightweight, seems well constructed and is reliable. I've worn it in temperatures as low as 13 degrees fahrenheit and it kept me warm. It's not one of those high-end down puffer jackets, but if you're looking for a lightweight jacket for being out and about in cold weather, this is solid. I've also heard of people stowing this jacket in its pack in their cars for emergencies, which is a great idea too."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Good jacket for the money,4.0,"Looks good and is breathable, but will still keep you warm. They must have fitted this for a square person with a big belly though. The bottom flares out for anyone with a beer belly lol. On a lighter note, it is still a good product and my favorite thing about this jacket is how comfortable it is. 4 stars. Btw I am 6’3 at 205 and athletic and I bought the XL. A large would probably fit my body better overall but probably be too short and ride up at my waistUpdate:I ordered the large to see if it fit better and it was in fact too small in the shoulders and only went down to my belt buckle. Dang, right in between sizes. Oh well, I’m returning the large and keeping the XL. There is such a difference between the two sizes that I think my XL may just have been improperly measured when made and that’s why the belly sticks out; or maybe they just figured anyone bigger than a size large probably has a beer belly and accommodated lol. Still 4 stars for the price and comfort. I think the only reason I’m making a big deal about it is because my girlfriend gave me a hard time about my apparent beer belly and I’m hung up on it. Anyhoo, plenty of room to grow so pass me a Guinness ;)"
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket,Size matters!,5.0,"First off, let me say that my whole family wears either Patagonia, North Face, or Columbia. Good stuff!....but I just can’t bring myself to spend $150+ dollars on a sweater or light jacket. If I was exploring Alaska or Northern Europe, then I would feel differently, but I’m not so I try and keep the expenses under control.I purchased this jacket on a whim and I’m quite happy with it. It’s light but surprisingly warm and with my rain jacket over it, I’ve never had even a chill. It comes with a little bag so it must scrunch up quite small although I’ve yet to attempt it. And a word about sizing. I usually buy a large, but after reading a number of reviews here, I decided to take their advice and go one size down. To all of you who suggested that, a big thank you.

My gift and intentions were a hit, because he loves this great jacket, already been wearing it a lot and the color indeed pairs well with most of his clothes.

Wrangler Authentics Men's Long Sleeve Quilted Lined Flannel Shirt Jacket with Hood,Lightweight and big around the mddle,3.0,"I like the look of this shirt-jacket.  It is really lightweight so it will not offer much in the way of warmth.  As a top layer on days above 60, it's fine but definitely not winter wear.  I am 6'1"" and 195lb with broad shoulders.  I ordered an XL and it fits well through the arms, shoulders and chest.  However, it is VERY big around the middle / waist.  I have a 33"" waist and i can gather nearly a foot of extra material at the waist.  I don't mind a little extra room especially in a jacket but it actually looks a little silly."

Wrangler Authentics Men's Long Sleeve Quilted Lined Flannel Shirt Jacket with Hood,Hot on Guys,5.0,"Bought this coat for my fiancé after realizing his old coat was 10 years old and small enough to fit me. He doesn’t usually wear a jacket out, but with the cold weather coming on, I wanted something to cover his arms when it snowed. He wanted a size up, so it wasn’t as form fitting as I wanted, and the material felt a little thin. It is incredibly warm, though, and he gets toasty quick! Didn’t have the color he wanted in his size? Otherwise, very good for the price and exactly what I needed."

Wrangler Authentics Men's Long Sleeve Quilted Lined Flannel Shirt Jacket with Hood,"My husband loves this great looking, warm flannel jacket!",5.0,"I ordered this lined flannel jacket with hoodie is the ""Total Eclipse With Heather Gray Hood"" color and size large, as gift for my husband to keep him warm during the cold months ahead. He's 5'10, 175 pounds and likes to buy alot of flannel lined shirts in XL to wear like a jacket, which is cool for the need to layer clothes perspective, but I felt this jacket would achieve the extra warmth way better, without the extra bulk and darker color will match nearly all his casual wear, too. My gift and intentions were a hit, because he loves this great jacket, already been wearing it a lot and the color indeed pairs well with most of his clothes. Best of all, I know he's staying warm during cool Fall nights and early hours of the day and so far, even without needing to wear extra layers... yet! The buttons, weight of flannel and craftsmanship of this nice looking jacket is high quality and made to last. We are both very happy with this purchase, absolutely recommend and would buy again."

Wrangler Authentics Men's Long Sleeve Quilted Lined Flannel Shirt Jacket with Hood,Hot on Guys,5.0,"Bought this coat for my fiancé after realizing his old coat was 10 years old and small enough to fit me. He doesn’t usually wear a jacket out, but with the cold weather coming on, I wanted something to cover his arms when it snowed. He wanted a size up, so it wasn’t as form fitting as I wanted, and the material felt a little thin. It is incredibly warm, though, and he gets toasty quick!

Wrangler Authentics Men's Long Sleeve Quilted Lined Flannel Shirt Jacket with Hood,"My husband loves this great looking, warm flannel jacket!",5.0,"I ordered this lined flannel jacket with hoodie is the ""Total Eclipse With Heather Gray Hood"" color and size large, as gift for my husband to keep him warm during the cold months ahead. He's 5'10, 175 pounds and likes to buy alot of flannel lined shirts in XL to wear like a jacket, which is cool for the need to layer clothes perspective, but I felt this jacket would achieve the extra warmth way better, without the extra bulk and darker color will match nearly all his casual wear, too. My gift and intentions were a hit, because he loves this great jacket, already been wearing it a lot and the color indeed pairs well with most of his clothes. Best of all, I know he's staying warm during cool Fall nights and early hours of the day and so far, even without needing to wear extra layers... yet! The buttons, weight of flannel and craftsmanship of this nice looking jacket is high quality and made to last. We are both very happy with this purchase, absolutely recommend and would buy again."

TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Casual Spring Fall Thin Bomber Zip Pockets Coat Outwear,A really slick and good looking jacket with an athletic fit.,5.0,"I picked this jacket up due to the generally positive reviews, and because my wife and I both thought it looked sharp.  I am 6'2"", 190 lbs.  I have a fairly athletic build. 32"" waist and 44"" jacket, and I purchased the large.  It fits me like I had it made to measure.  Plenty of sleeve length, a good fit around the wrists and neck, and surprisingly, a taper to the waist that is not often found in inexpensive clothes.  It produces a leaner profile.  The zippers are of excellent quality with substantial all-steel pulls.  The left bicep pocket is actually useful at times, but I mostly keep candy in it. It would probably work well for an ipod.  This is a good light jacket for athletic use or in moderate weather.  I have had this jacket a little while and it does a pretty good job of stopping rain and wind from spoiling your fun, and is also stylish enough to wear casually."

The jacket is light but heavier than a windbreaker but i doubt you can feel the difference when you put it on. The zipper is so smooth too when you zip up and down. Doesn't make that nasty cheap zippers noise or stops you every inch. But I dont like how there's no patting or that criss cross patting to keep you warm like at least a little. I thought I bought a ""bomber jacket"" not a bomber jacket like that's a wind breaker. I will be keeping it though. Luckily I bought a bigger size on accident.

TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Casual Spring Fall Thin Bomber Zip Pockets Coat Outwear,Awesome for men and women!,5.0,I bought this because women’s jackets are overpriced and usually have sleeves that don’t reach my wrists. Freaking loooove this jacket. It’s simple and light. It’s very well made and would recommend to any gender!
TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Casual Spring Fall Thin Bomber Zip Pockets Coat Outwear,Cheap windbreaker,2.0,"First, it's just a windbreaker, not a jacket.  No insulation.  Fit and color are okay.  The zippers are cheap metal.  The main zipper is backwards for a man's jacket, better for a left-handed person.  The zippered pocket on the sleeve has the stitching coming loose after just three wearings, I'll have to mend it soon.  Next time I'll shop more carefully."
TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Casual Spring Fall Thin Bomber Zip Pockets Coat Outwear,Wrong Gender Sent,3.0,"I ordered the Men's Jacket-Lightweight Casual Spring Jacket, but received a Women's Jacket-Lightweight Jacket. The jacket itself fit perfectly, with the exception of the zipping on the wrong side for me. In fact, I like the jacket so much that I will order another ""Men's Jacket-Lightweight Casual Spring Fall Flight Bomber Jacket"".  However, if I receive another women's jacket I will return the item."
TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Casual Spring Fall Thin Bomber Zip Pockets Coat Outwear,CHEAP QUALITY. DONT WASTE MONEY,1.0,The product has a very cheap quality. The zippers are very cheap and the material used is extremely low quality
TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Casual Spring Fall Thin Bomber Zip Pockets Coat Outwear,SOOO small!,4.0,"Let me start out by saying I had to order 3 of these, each one a different size up in order to find one that wasn't made for a 9 year old.These run super small. My shirt size is a USA medium/large, I'm 5 foot 11 muscular build, and the large was terribly small.I might have fit into it when I was 14, maybe.If you're going to order this, think 2 to 3 sizes bigger. The one that I eventually ended up getting that didn't constrict my body into unconciousness ended up being  XL, and it still fits a bit slim.Otherwise, it's a nice little super ultra light jacket. Kinda feels like wearing a garbage bag with some thin cloth around it, which was great during summer."
TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Casual Spring Fall Thin Bomber Zip Pockets Coat Outwear,Shiny Zippers ruin the jacket,1.0,"Everything is fine about the jacket but the zippers are obnoxiously shiny and bright compared to the muted base color.  Looking at it all a person would think is SHINY ZIPPERS.  Pretty dorky looking for a bomber, which is supposed to be low profile and minimalistic.  The zippers are shinier than the pictures represent."
TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Casual Spring Fall Thin Bomber Zip Pockets Coat Outwear,A really slick and good looking jacket with an athletic fit.,5.0,"I picked this jacket up due to the generally positive reviews, and because my wife and I both thought it looked sharp.  I am 6'2"", 190 lbs.  I have a fairly athletic build. 32"" waist and 44"" jacket, and I purchased the large.  It fits me like I had it made to measure.  Plenty of sleeve length, a good fit around the wrists and neck, and surprisingly, a taper to the waist that is not often found in inexpensive clothes.  It produces a leaner profile.  The zippers are of excellent quality with substantial all-steel pulls.  The left bicep pocket is actually useful at times, but I mostly keep candy in it. It would probably work well for an ipod.  This is a good light jacket for athletic use or in moderate weather.  I have had this jacket a little while and it does a pretty good job of stopping rain and wind from spoiling your fun, and is also stylish enough to wear casually."
TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Casual Spring Fall Thin Bomber Zip Pockets Coat Outwear,"Does not keep you warm but its light, stylish, high-quality and windbreaker-ish",4.0,"I bought this for my boyfriend.What i do like is the material its a wind breaker but its so smooth like, high quality material. The jacket is light but heavier than a windbreaker but i doubt you can feel the difference when you put it on. The zipper is so smooth too when you zip up and down. Doesn't make that nasty cheap zippers noise or stops you every inch. But I dont like how there's no patting or that criss cross patting to keep you warm like at least a little. I thought I bought a ""bomber jacket"" not a bomber jacket like that's a wind breaker. I will be keeping it though. Luckily I bought a bigger size on accident. I'll just have my boyfriend wear it over a hooded sweater."

TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Casual Spring Fall Thin Bomber Zip Pockets Coat Outwear,SOOO small!,4.0,"Let me start out by saying I had to order 3 of these, each one a different size up in order to find one that wasn't made for a 9 year old.These run super small. My shirt size is a USA medium/large, I'm 5 foot 11 muscular build, and the large was terribly small.I might have fit into it when I was 14, maybe.If you're going to order this, think 2 to 3 sizes bigger. The one that I eventually ended up getting that didn't constrict my body into unconciousness ended up being  XL, and it still fits a bit slim.Otherwise, it's a nice little super ultra light jacket. Kinda feels like wearing a garbage bag with some thin cloth around it, which was great during summer."
TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Casual Spring Fall Thin Bomber Zip Pockets Coat Outwear,Shiny Zippers ruin the jacket,1.0,"Everything is fine about the jacket but the zippers are obnoxiously shiny and bright compared to the muted base color.

TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Casual Spring Fall Thin Bomber Zip Pockets Coat Outwear,A really slick and good looking jacket with an athletic fit.,5.0,"I picked this jacket up due to the generally positive reviews, and because my wife and I both thought it looked sharp.  I am 6'2"", 190 lbs.  I have a fairly athletic build. 32"" waist and 44"" jacket, and I purchased the large.  It fits me like I had it made to measure.  Plenty of sleeve length, a good fit around the wrists and neck, and surprisingly, a taper to the waist that is not often found in inexpensive clothes.  It produces a leaner profile.  The zippers are of excellent quality with substantial all-steel pulls.  The left bicep pocket is actually useful at times, but I mostly keep candy in it. It would probably work well for an ipod.  This is a good light jacket for athletic use or in moderate weather.  I have had this jacket a little while and it does a pretty good job of stopping rain and wind from spoiling your fun, and is also stylish enough to wear casually."
TACVASEN Men's Jacket-Lightweight Casual Spring Fall Thin Bomber Zip Pockets Coat Outwear,"Does not keep you warm but its light, stylish, high-quality and windbreaker-ish",4.0,"I bought this for my boyfriend.What i do like is the material its a wind breaker but its so smooth like, high quality material. The jacket is light but heavier than a windbreaker but i doubt you can feel the difference when you put it on. The zipper is so smooth too when you zip up and down. Doesn't make that nasty cheap zippers noise or stops you every inch. But I dont like how there's no patting or that criss cross patting to keep you warm like at least a little. I thought I bought a ""bomber jacket"" not a bomber jacket like that's a wind breaker. I will be keeping it though. Luckily I bought a bigger size on accident. I'll just have my boyfriend wear it over a hooded sweater."

Volcom Men's Brighton Pullover Anarok Hooded Snowboard Jacket,"Great fit, feel, and function, all while looking cool enough to steal.",5.0,"I'm an east coast snowboard instructor of four years and bought this in November 2019 as my personal jacket for the winter season.I bought a medium and it fits well as a 6' slim guy, and I never had a problem with rain or water coming through. Brest pockets are well supported and the hoodie pocket is lined. Storage is different compared to a normal style jacket and there are less pockets, but the pockets you do get are large and work great. You can fit 7 PBR's comfortably, maybe 9 if you push it but I wouldn't ride in it that way. The hood has a lot of adjustment features that are a nice touch. Fully expanded accommodates a helmet just fine, and cinching the rear tightens it down for regular use well.The only downsides of this jacket come from the pull over side zip design. Your jacket has to go on before the helmet and vice versa. It only really has one vent at the left armpit. The right side is a double zipper that extends from the hem up past the armpit. I would keep it open like a vent most of the time and use the other zipper for opening and closing the jacket. Overall it's a solid wind and water shell that doesn't break the bank.My multi color variant looked awesome performed well with no real complaints for about 2/3 of the season. I got many compliments on the look of the jacket, it was quite popular. So popular in fact that a couple dudes decided to steal it. Feels bad man."
Volcom Men's Brighton Pullover Anarok Hooded Snowboard Jacket,Quality Jacket,4.0,"Very warm, cool features. Love the kangaroo pocket. The hood is actually sized so you can wear it over your helmet. There are clips built into the hood that attach to your helmet too, so when you turn your head, the hood turns with you. Couple things I’d like this jacket to have (that it doesn’t):Wrist gaiters. My last few jackets have had them and I took them for granted.I wish the side zipper had a more substantial pull. It’s fine when you don’t have gloves on, but impossible to grab with a gloved hand. I bought some extenders, designed for people with poor dexterity, that work like a champ.The side zipper isn’t vented at all. You can open the vent on your right, but on the left side the zipper just opens to the world."

Volcom Men's Brighton Pullover Anarok Hooded Snowboard Jacket,"Great fit, feel, and function, all while looking cool enough to steal.",5.0,"I'm an east coast snowboard instructor of four years and bought this in November 2019 as my personal jacket for the winter season.I bought a medium and it fits well as a 6' slim guy, and I never had a problem with rain or water coming through. Brest pockets are well supported and the hoodie pocket is lined. Storage is different compared to a normal style jacket and there are less pockets, but the pockets you do get are large and work great. You can fit 7 PBR's comfortably, maybe 9 if you push it but I wouldn't ride in it that way. The hood has a lot of adjustment features that are a nice touch. Fully expanded accommodates a helmet just fine, and cinching the rear tightens it down for regular use well.The only downsides of this jacket come from the pull over side zip design. Your jacket has to go on before the helmet and vice versa. It only really has one vent at the left armpit. The right side is a double zipper that extends from the hem up past the armpit. I would keep it open like a vent most of the time and use the other zipper for opening and closing the jacket. Overall it's a solid wind and water shell that doesn't break the bank.My multi color variant looked awesome performed well with no real complaints for about 2/3 of the season. I got many compliments on the look of the jacket, it was quite popular. So popular in fact that a couple dudes decided to steal it. Feels bad man."

Volcom Men's Brighton Pullover Anarok Hooded Snowboard Jacket,"Great fit, feel, and function, all while looking cool enough to steal.",5.0,"I'm an east coast snowboard instructor of four years and bought this in November 2019 as my personal jacket for the winter season.I bought a medium and it fits well as a 6' slim guy, and I never had a problem with rain or water coming through. Brest pockets are well supported and the hoodie pocket is lined. Storage is different compared to a normal style jacket and there are less pockets, but the pockets you do get are large and work great. You can fit 7 PBR's comfortably, maybe 9 if you push it but I wouldn't ride in it that way. The hood has a lot of adjustment features that are a nice touch. Fully expanded accommodates a helmet just fine, and cinching the rear tightens it down for regular use well.The only downsides of this jacket come from the pull over side zip design. Your jacket has to go on before the helmet and vice versa. It only really has one vent at the left armpit. The right side is a double zipper that extends from the hem up past the armpit. I would keep it open like a vent most of the time and use the other zipper for opening and closing the jacket. Overall it's a solid wind and water shell that doesn't break the bank.My multi color variant looked awesome performed well with no real complaints for about 2/3 of the season. I got many compliments on the look of the jacket, it was quite popular. So popular in fact that a couple dudes decided to steal it. Feels bad man."

My last few jackets have had them and I took them for granted.I wish the side zipper had a more substantial pull. It’s fine when you don’t have gloves on, but impossible to grab with a gloved hand.

Champion Men's Packable Jacket,Expected better quality,1.0,Ordered this April 29th only worn maybe 7x I look down today and see this
Champion Men's Packable Jacket,Ookay,3.0,"So it serves the purpose of a rain jacket very well, but it doesn't come with the ""fake"" champion logo on the front, so it really just looks like a high quality shopping bag. To answer any questions anyone may have, yes this is fake. Personally I think there's cuter raincoats out there, but it's okay still."
Champion Men's Packable Jacket,Great Product,5.0,"I bought my husband a 2X. It is an official champion product. Their website was sold out, so I was pleased to find one on Amazon. My husband is 6 feet tall and has large shoulders and arms. The jacket fell right by his belt. I thought it would be a concern, but it looks really nice on him."
Champion Men's Packable Jacket,Great and Versatile,5.0,"Was a Christmas gift for my son, who is very picky with clothing (teenager) and he loved it. Was exactly what I expected. Great quality."
Champion Men's Packable Jacket,Not as pictured,3.0,The jacket wasn’t the same as the one pictured. The one in the pic has the champion logo on the chest as well and mine only had one on the sleeve. Kind of annoying. Otherwise looks fine.
Champion Men's Packable Jacket,sent it back and had to pay return shipping!,2.0,This was suppose to be a 2X Mans. I buy 2X clothes all the time a normal large is tight on me this was even tighter than that. I don't know if this was miss marked or what I could just verily smash myself into it I am very disappointed. I own many Hanes tie shirts and sweat shirts that are 2X no problems that is why I  think this might be missed marked. I don't feel like I want to go through this again without trying it on before buying. You have to pay return shipping on this so don't buy this unless you are sure that is will fit and this is a retailor apart from amazon so this cost me something like 9 dollars to try this on.
Champion Men's Packable Jacket,Not really sure what to think,3.0,"Ive worn one wind breaker before and if fit lose and stopped all the wind. This one the fit is to snug when trying to put it on, but once its on i guess its decent...wonder how a bigger size would fit.  This material transfers the cold if you try to lean on something, and also doesn't stop all the wind. Again not to sure what to think as i really don't need a jacket just bought it for when i run when its a little colder outside. But i think hoodies work better."
Champion Men's Packable Jacket,Little big but works and feels great,5.0,"I love this style windbreaker, bought one for my brother as a gift and liked how it looked and felt so i bought one for myself, definitely will need some tailoring for much slimmer people like myself. Jacket length is good, it’s right under my belt, fit at chest is very loose. the product overall fits loose but i will be wearing a sweater under it anyways so it’s not a big deal. overall great product, i would recommend but like i said will probably need some tailoring for slimmer people."
Champion Men's Packable Jacket,A convenient jacket.,5.0,"Purchased this product from a different company and color some months ago. Fits great. Very light, comfortable to wear on nice days. Having a large front pouch pocket is convenient for carrying around keys, wallets, hand sanitizer and facial coverings. Wind resistant and easy to wash. I recommend hang drying in order to keep it looking nice."

I buy 2X clothes all the time a normal large is tight on me this was even tighter than that. I don't know if this was miss marked or what I could just verily smash myself into it I am very disappointed. I own many Hanes tie shirts and sweat shirts that are 2X no problems that is why I  think this might be missed marked. I don't feel like I want to go through this again without trying it on before buying. You have to pay return shipping on this so don't buy this unless you are sure that is will fit and this is a retailor apart from amazon so this cost me something like 9 dollars to try this on.
Champion Men's Packable Jacket,Not really sure what to think,3.0,"Ive worn one wind breaker before and if fit lose and stopped all the wind. This one the fit is to snug when trying to put it on, but once its on i guess its decent...wonder how a bigger size would fit.  This material transfers the cold if you try to lean on something, and also doesn't stop all the wind. Again not to sure what to think as i really don't need a jacket just bought it for when i run when its a little colder outside. But i think hoodies work better."
Champion Men's Packable Jacket,Little big but works and feels great,5.0,"I love this style windbreaker, bought one for my brother as a gift and liked how it looked and felt so i bought one for myself, definitely will need some tailoring for much slimmer people like myself. Jacket length is good, it’s right under my belt, fit at chest is very loose. the product overall fits loose but i will be wearing a sweater under it anyways so it’s not a big deal. overall great product, i would recommend but like i said will probably need some tailoring for slimmer people."
Champion Men's Packable Jacket,A convenient jacket.,5.0,"Purchased this product from a different company and color some months ago. Fits great. Very light, comfortable to wear on nice days. Having a large front pouch pocket is convenient for carrying around keys, wallets, hand sanitizer and facial coverings. Wind resistant and easy to wash. I recommend hang drying in order to keep it looking nice."
Champion Men's Packable Jacket,Love it,5.0,I love that it’s just like the picture
Champion Men's Packable Jacket,Expected better quality,1.0,Ordered this April 29th only worn maybe 7x I look down today and see this
Champion Men's Packable Jacket,Ookay,3.0,"So it serves the purpose of a rain jacket very well, but it doesn't come with the ""fake"" champion logo on the front, so it really just looks like a high quality shopping bag. To answer any questions anyone may have, yes this is fake. Personally I think there's cuter raincoats out there, but it's okay still."
Champion Men's Packable Jacket,Great Product,5.0,"I bought my husband a 2X. It is an official champion product. Their website was sold out, so I was pleased to find one on Amazon. My husband is 6 feet tall and has large shoulders and arms. The jacket fell right by his belt. I thought it would be a concern, but it looks really nice on him."
Champion Men's Packable Jacket,Great and Versatile,5.0,"Was a Christmas gift for my son, who is very picky with clothing (teenager) and he loved it. Was exactly what I expected. Great quality."

I buy 2X clothes all the time a normal large is tight on me this was even tighter than that. I don't know if this was miss marked or what I could just verily smash myself into it I am very disappointed. I own many Hanes tie shirts and sweat shirts that are 2X no problems that is why I  think this might be missed marked. I don't feel like I want to go through this again without trying it on before buying. You have to pay return shipping on this so don't buy this unless you are sure that is will fit and this is a retailor apart from amazon so this cost me something like 9 dollars to try this on.
Champion Men's Packable Jacket,Not really sure what to think,3.0,"Ive worn one wind breaker before and if fit lose and stopped all the wind. This one the fit is to snug when trying to put it on, but once its on i guess its decent...wonder how a bigger size would fit.  This material transfers the cold if you try to lean on something, and also doesn't stop all the wind. Again not to sure what to think as i really don't need a jacket just bought it for when i run when its a little colder outside. But i think hoodies work better."
Champion Men's Packable Jacket,Little big but works and feels great,5.0,"I love this style windbreaker, bought one for my brother as a gift and liked how it looked and felt so i bought one for myself, definitely will need some tailoring for much slimmer people like myself. Jacket length is good, it’s right under my belt, fit at chest is very loose. the product overall fits loose but i will be wearing a sweater under it anyways so it’s not a big deal. overall great product, i would recommend but like i said will probably need some tailoring for slimmer people."
Champion Men's Packable Jacket,A convenient jacket.,5.0,"Purchased this product from a different company and color some months ago. Fits great. Very light, comfortable to wear on nice days. Having a large front pouch pocket is convenient for carrying around keys, wallets, hand sanitizer and facial coverings. Wind resistant and easy to wash. I recommend hang drying in order to keep it looking nice."
Champion Men's Packable Jacket,Love it,5.0,I love that it’s just like the picture
Champion Men's Packable Jacket,Expected better quality,1.0,Ordered this April 29th only worn maybe 7x I look down today and see this
Champion Men's Packable Jacket,Ookay,3.0,"So it serves the purpose of a rain jacket very well, but it doesn't come with the ""fake"" champion logo on the front, so it really just looks like a high quality shopping bag. To answer any questions anyone may have, yes this is fake. Personally I think there's cuter raincoats out there, but it's okay still."
Champion Men's Packable Jacket,Great Product,5.0,"I bought my husband a 2X. It is an official champion product. Their website was sold out, so I was pleased to find one on Amazon. My husband is 6 feet tall and has large shoulders and arms. The jacket fell right by his belt. I thought it would be a concern, but it looks really nice on him."

MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Best coat ive owned,5.0,"This coat is amazing. It completely blocks the wind and rain. The coat is also very warm and fits perfect. I am 5'-9"" and 160lbs and it fits good with room for layers underneath if neededThe only negative i can think of is that the zippers seem a little cheap but so far they are holding up great.I was on the top of the Alps last week with just this coat, a long sleeve and a short sleave during a blizzard and was good to go"
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Better quality than Expected!,5.0,"Fits perfectly. As soon as I stepped out some one assumed it was a very expensive jacket. It keeps me extremely warm. The hood feels good on my head, it's removable and has a high quality velcro type strap plus strings. Pockets are accessible and convenient. It's not too big at all and is flexible with how you need to move about. so far so good."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Great jacket for cold & wet weather,5.0,"I bought this for my husband. He delivers gas for a living and in the winter it gets cold and wet. This jacket was perfect considering it was waterproof and warm, not to mention decently priced. He immediately tested its claim of being water proof. He put it on and stood in the shower. Definitely worth the money lmao"
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Get Fit and Function !,5.0,"I live in Houston where it can be very difficult to find a jacket, I went on lineand got lucky - this jacket deserves all the good reviews, it fits me like aglove ( Large size, I am 6 foot ! 165 lbs, long arms)  Lots of pockets,feels very cozy, I could not be any more pleased..  Thanks !"
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Well Done!,5.0,"Reviews for quality and size are accurate. I'm 5'9"" 175lbs and the large was very big on me even with a hoodie underneath. The medium fits perfect. I've only had it for a week and the quality is great so far. I got a compliment on the very first day."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Wind Warrior,5.0,"This coat has been a great tool for fighting winter weather in the Pacific Northwest. Freezing rain, fog, and snow don't stand a chance. I got this coat to be able to ride an ATV to plow snow and found it to be warm, comfortable, and easy to move in. It also provides a solid windproof barrier that I could tell was much better than my old parka. I can easily ride in freezing temperatures for hours at up to 30 mph - no problem.I got the ""Army Green"" and it seemed to be more like a split-pea green so I'll probably get another one in black and use it for the wet, dirty outdoor chores. Overall, very impressed. I'm 5'10"" and 150 lbs., so lean and mean but no problem with the fit. Sleeves might be a bit tight on popeye but there's plenty of room for you barrel-chested or beer-belly champions out there.The only thing that was a bit of a drawback was the hood, which runs a little small. Nothing a normal ballcap can't fill-in. Also, the zipper is a right-hand closure, so it might have been a mistake in the sewing process. I'd like to have had insulated pockets but they serve their purpose. Will definitely buy another one soon."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,"So I read a review that said this coat is for large people, they were right",4.0,"Brooklyn Review: I bought this coat because someone had written in their review that they were dissatisfied because this was  a coat for ""fat people."" I know I should have been outraged, but instead I realized that this was the coat for me. I have owned the coat for a few months now and it is wicked hot. The outer shell keeps out the rain and the cold. The light fleece on the inside makes me sweat. The price was worth it.So why not 5 stars?The problem is that the zippers are cheaply made. They look cool, but easily get jammed and fall off their track. I had to make a small stitch at the beginning and end of each pocket to prevent the zipper from falling off the track on all the pockets. Also, the fleece on the inside of my jacket had a section where the stitching came undone and I had to patch it up. Nothing crazy, but when you buy something new you don't expect to have to do some tailoring. The hood although still usable seems to run a little small, almost like it is out of proportion with the overall jacket.However, if the company can correct these three issues with a little more quality control and design checks this coat could easily sell for more and be a big hit. To the designer consider creating a female companion to this coat, but check the measurements for your intended consumer target."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Almost perfect,3.0,"I purchase 3 of these jackets, two for men (medium black camo, 2XL army green) and one for women (large black). Overall it is a good jacket but lacks one fundamental feature required to maintain body heat, a draw cord hem, without it, the body insulation that a good mountain snow jacket is supposed to provide, is gone. As simple as it sounds, sports such as downhill skiing, and snowboarding, expose the body to consistent winds, the body must remain insulated all the way around (cuffs, hem, neck, and face). These are the advantages, disadvantages, and other details of this garment.PROS:- The outer shell is relatively thick, the fabric feels sturdy and capable of handling abrasion.- The inner lining is very soft and comfortable, it is not as bulky as the Sherpa lining found in other Sherpa jackets but good enough.- The fibers of the inner lining are approximately 4mm long and allow reasonable airflow.- The inner lining of the hood fees comfortable, the hood provides a drawcord.- The cuffs can be adjusted to the wrist with velcros.- The men's medium size is true and it matches the dimensions provided by the manufacturer.- The women's large size is true and it matches the dimensions provided by the manufacturer.CONS:- The lack of a draw cord hem is a critical failure.- The zipper flap along the jacket should have snaps or velcros to prevent it from flapping around while under windy conditions, it has just two metal snaps, one close to the neck and one at the bottom of the hem.- The manufacturer does not specify, but the jacket appears to be 10000mm waterproof. 10K is enough to handle light to average rain for a short amount of time. Ratings between 10K and 15K can handle a moderate amount of rain for much longer, and jackets rated between 15K and 20K or higher are serious shells for heavy, intense rain over a prolonged period. This jacket will handle light rain but it is not a rain jacket.- The jacket is too stiff for rock climbing or cycling as advertised by the manufacturer.RECOMMENDATION:Other than the draw cord hem, it is a good jacket, but those that are looking to wear it for its advertised purpose (sports such as downhill skiing, and snowboarding) will find the draw cord to be a deal breaker, but if you don’t mind it or you can have one installed, then, it is a good product. In my case, I returned them because I plan on wearing them for sports activities under very windy conditions. There are similar products from different brands that include this detail."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Excellent,5.0,"Very impressed with the jacket. It came in two days of shipping and the packaging was very good. It’s light weight and surprisingly warm. I had my doubts, but so far it’s been a great jacket. We just got dumped on with a bunch of snow and I wore it with just my t-shirt underneath the jacket shoveling snow and it kept me warm. It was 25 degrees out by the way. But if you were not going to do any activities in it, I’d would wear a hoodie underneath it. Just for extra warmth. The sizing is right. I’m 5’6 and 170 pounds and the large fits really good with extra room for a hoodie comfortably. I washed it as soon as I got it. I washed it in cold water and dried it on low heat and it passed the test with no issues. It’s actually waterproof. Snow and rain didn’t penetrate the jacket at all. You can’t beat the price. I’m a very picky coat person and I do a lot of research before purchasing anything. I’m glad I went with this jacket. Overall, I’m just impressed with this jacket and would recommend it. Hope this helps."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Far exceeded expectations!,5.0,"Here are some details on this jacket's features, in order of importance.FIT: I am 5'7"", 143 lbs and usually order a men's ""small."" That's what I ordered and it fit me perfectly. It's roomy enough to layer a sweatshirt or heavy sweater underneath. My arms have a good range of motion in this jacket; it's not tight anywhere. It's longer than a bomber but not as long as a parka.WARMTH: This is an extremely warm, comfortable jacket. The pile (faux fur) lining is very effective. I've worn it in 25 degree weather so far, with a sweatshirt underneath and felt very snug. It has a zip-through collar that hugs your throat, keeping it protected.WATERPROOF: On two days when I walked my dog, it started raining. This jacket sheds water remarkably well. The rain just beaded up on the shell and ran off. I was very pleased with the rain protection quality.WINDPROOF:  The polyester fabric does an excellent job of blocking the wind. On cold, windy days, the wind chill didn't affect me at all.HOOD: A warm hood is a MUST here in the Midwest. This one features the same, ultra-warm pile lining as the jacket. We like to wear a stocking cap under the hood for complete warmth. This hood is plenty roomy for my thickest stocking cap. It has a hook-and-loop fastener 3/4"" wide by 2"" long. I don't know how this will hold up over time. It may be a bit skimpy. The hood has push-button toggles to tighten the string and hold it in place, much preferable to trying to tie a drawstring in cold weather. The hood zips off, if you want to remove it.POCKETS: The two outside, bottom pockets have zippers. I don't know if that's necessary, but some folks may like them. I wear thick, insulated gloves and they easily fit in these deep pockets. The outside, left breast pocket measures 3.5"" wide by 7"" deep and is zippered. The inside pocket is 5.5"" wide by 7"" deep and zippered.CUFF CLOSURES: Each cuff has an exterior hook-and-loop closure to tighten the end of the sleeve. I haven't adjusted these because there's also some elastic inside the cuffs that keeps them tight around your wrist so wind doesn't blow in.DETAILS: On the outer right breast of the jacket is embroidered lettering that says: ""V.A. TOR 189  UNCO & BOROR"" with an embroidered logo. I have no idea what any of that means, but frankly, I don't care. This jacket is so warm and comfortable that I'm willing to overlook this mystery.OVERALL IMPRESSION: A completely superior product that far exceeded my expectations. If the nylon zipper holds up (and I have no reason to believe it won't; it works smoothly), I expect many years of good service from this jacket. Well, well worth the money."

As soon as I stepped out some one assumed it was a very expensive jacket. It keeps me extremely warm.

MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Wind Warrior,5.0,"This coat has been a great tool for fighting winter weather in the Pacific Northwest. Freezing rain, fog, and snow don't stand a chance. I got this coat to be able to ride an ATV to plow snow and found it to be warm, comfortable, and easy to move in. It also provides a solid windproof barrier that I could tell was much better than my old parka. I can easily ride in freezing temperatures for hours at up to 30 mph - no problem.I got the ""Army Green"" and it seemed to be more like a split-pea green so I'll probably get another one in black and use it for the wet, dirty outdoor chores. Overall, very impressed. I'm 5'10"" and 150 lbs., so lean and mean but no problem with the fit. Sleeves might be a bit tight on popeye but there's plenty of room for you barrel-chested or beer-belly champions out there.The only thing that was a bit of a drawback was the hood, which runs a little small. Nothing a normal ballcap can't fill-in. Also, the zipper is a right-hand closure, so it might have been a mistake in the sewing process. I'd like to have had insulated pockets but they serve their purpose. Will definitely buy another one soon."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,"So I read a review that said this coat is for large people, they were right",4.0,"Brooklyn Review: I bought this coat because someone had written in their review that they were dissatisfied because this was  a coat for ""fat people."" I know I should have been outraged, but instead I realized that this was the coat for me. I have owned the coat for a few months now and it is wicked hot. The outer shell keeps out the rain and the cold. The light fleece on the inside makes me sweat. The price was worth it.So why not 5 stars?The problem is that the zippers are cheaply made. They look cool, but easily get jammed and fall off their track. I had to make a small stitch at the beginning and end of each pocket to prevent the zipper from falling off the track on all the pockets. Also, the fleece on the inside of my jacket had a section where the stitching came undone and I had to patch it up. Nothing crazy, but when you buy something new you don't expect to have to do some tailoring. The hood although still usable seems to run a little small, almost like it is out of proportion with the overall jacket.However, if the company can correct these three issues with a little more quality control and design checks this coat could easily sell for more and be a big hit. To the designer consider creating a female companion to this coat, but check the measurements for your intended consumer target."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Almost perfect,3.0,"I purchase 3 of these jackets, two for men (medium black camo, 2XL army green) and one for women (large black). Overall it is a good jacket but lacks one fundamental feature required to maintain body heat, a draw cord hem, without it, the body insulation that a good mountain snow jacket is supposed to provide, is gone. As simple as it sounds, sports such as downhill skiing, and snowboarding, expose the body to consistent winds, the body must remain insulated all the way around (cuffs, hem, neck, and face). These are the advantages, disadvantages, and other details of this garment.PROS:- The outer shell is relatively thick, the fabric feels sturdy and capable of handling abrasion.- The inner lining is very soft and comfortable, it is not as bulky as the Sherpa lining found in other Sherpa jackets but good enough.- The fibers of the inner lining are approximately 4mm long and allow reasonable airflow.- The inner lining of the hood fees comfortable, the hood provides a drawcord.- The cuffs can be adjusted to the wrist with velcros.- The men's medium size is true and it matches the dimensions provided by the manufacturer.- The women's large size is true and it matches the dimensions provided by the manufacturer.CONS:- The lack of a draw cord hem is a critical failure.- The zipper flap along the jacket should have snaps or velcros to prevent it from flapping around while under windy conditions, it has just two metal snaps, one close to the neck and one at the bottom of the hem.- The manufacturer does not specify, but the jacket appears to be 10000mm waterproof. 10K is enough to handle light to average rain for a short amount of time. Ratings between 10K and 15K can handle a moderate amount of rain for much longer, and jackets rated between 15K and 20K or higher are serious shells for heavy, intense rain over a prolonged period. This jacket will handle light rain but it is not a rain jacket.- The jacket is too stiff for rock climbing or cycling as advertised by the manufacturer.RECOMMENDATION:Other than the draw cord hem, it is a good jacket, but those that are looking to wear it for its advertised purpose (sports such as downhill skiing, and snowboarding) will find the draw cord to be a deal breaker, but if you don’t mind it or you can have one installed, then, it is a good product. In my case, I returned them because I plan on wearing them for sports activities under very windy conditions. There are similar products from different brands that include this detail."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Excellent,5.0,"Very impressed with the jacket. It came in two days of shipping and the packaging was very good. It’s light weight and surprisingly warm. I had my doubts, but so far it’s been a great jacket. We just got dumped on with a bunch of snow and I wore it with just my t-shirt underneath the jacket shoveling snow and it kept me warm. It was 25 degrees out by the way. But if you were not going to do any activities in it, I’d would wear a hoodie underneath it. Just for extra warmth. The sizing is right. I’m 5’6 and 170 pounds and the large fits really good with extra room for a hoodie comfortably. I washed it as soon as I got it. I washed it in cold water and dried it on low heat and it passed the test with no issues. It’s actually waterproof. Snow and rain didn’t penetrate the jacket at all. You can’t beat the price. I’m a very picky coat person and I do a lot of research before purchasing anything. I’m glad I went with this jacket. Overall, I’m just impressed with this jacket and would recommend it. Hope this helps."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Far exceeded expectations!,5.0,"Here are some details on this jacket's features, in order of importance.FIT: I am 5'7"", 143 lbs and usually order a men's ""small."" That's what I ordered and it fit me perfectly. It's roomy enough to layer a sweatshirt or heavy sweater underneath. My arms have a good range of motion in this jacket; it's not tight anywhere. It's longer than a bomber but not as long as a parka.WARMTH: This is an extremely warm, comfortable jacket. The pile (faux fur) lining is very effective. I've worn it in 25 degree weather so far, with a sweatshirt underneath and felt very snug. It has a zip-through collar that hugs your throat, keeping it protected.WATERPROOF: On two days when I walked my dog, it started raining. This jacket sheds water remarkably well. The rain just beaded up on the shell and ran off. I was very pleased with the rain protection quality.WINDPROOF:  The polyester fabric does an excellent job of blocking the wind. On cold, windy days, the wind chill didn't affect me at all.HOOD: A warm hood is a MUST here in the Midwest. This one features the same, ultra-warm pile lining as the jacket. We like to wear a stocking cap under the hood for complete warmth. This hood is plenty roomy for my thickest stocking cap. It has a hook-and-loop fastener 3/4"" wide by 2"" long. I don't know how this will hold up over time. It may be a bit skimpy. The hood has push-button toggles to tighten the string and hold it in place, much preferable to trying to tie a drawstring in cold weather. The hood zips off, if you want to remove it.POCKETS: The two outside, bottom pockets have zippers. I don't know if that's necessary, but some folks may like them. I wear thick, insulated gloves and they easily fit in these deep pockets. The outside, left breast pocket measures 3.5"" wide by 7"" deep and is zippered. The inside pocket is 5.5"" wide by 7"" deep and zippered.CUFF CLOSURES: Each cuff has an exterior hook-and-loop closure to tighten the end of the sleeve. I haven't adjusted these because there's also some elastic inside the cuffs that keeps them tight around your wrist so wind doesn't blow in.DETAILS: On the outer right breast of the jacket is embroidered lettering that says: ""V.A. TOR 189  UNCO & BOROR"" with an embroidered logo. I have no idea what any of that means, but frankly, I don't care. This jacket is so warm and comfortable that I'm willing to overlook this mystery.OVERALL IMPRESSION: A completely superior product that far exceeded my expectations. If the nylon zipper holds up (and I have no reason to believe it won't; it works smoothly), I expect many years of good service from this jacket. Well, well worth the money."

I wear thick, insulated gloves and they easily fit in these deep pockets. The outside, left breast pocket measures 3.5"" wide by 7"" deep and is zippered. The inside pocket is 5.5"" wide by 7"" deep and zippered.CUFF CLOSURES: Each cuff has an exterior hook-and-loop closure to tighten the end of the sleeve. I haven't adjusted these because there's also some elastic inside the cuffs that keeps them tight around your wrist so wind doesn't blow in.DETAILS: On the outer right breast of the jacket is embroidered lettering that says: ""V.A. TOR 189  UNCO & BOROR"" with an embroidered logo. I have no idea what any of that means, but frankly, I don't care. This jacket is so warm and comfortable that I'm willing to overlook this mystery.OVERALL IMPRESSION: A completely superior product that far exceeded my expectations. If the nylon zipper holds up (and I have no reason to believe it won't; it works smoothly), I expect many years of good service from this jacket. Well, well worth the money."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Best coat ive owned,5.0,"This coat is amazing. It completely blocks the wind and rain. The coat is also very warm and fits perfect. I am 5'-9"" and 160lbs and it fits good with room for layers underneath if neededThe only negative i can think of is that the zippers seem a little cheap but so far they are holding up great.I was on the top of the Alps last week with just this coat, a long sleeve and a short sleave during a blizzard and was good to go"
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Better quality than Expected!,5.0,"Fits perfectly. As soon as I stepped out some one assumed it was a very expensive jacket. It keeps me extremely warm. The hood feels good on my head, it's removable and has a high quality velcro type strap plus strings. Pockets are accessible and convenient. It's not too big at all and is flexible with how you need to move about. so far so good."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Great jacket for cold & wet weather,5.0,"I bought this for my husband.

MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Get Fit and Function !,5.0,"I live in Houston where it can be very difficult to find a jacket, I went on lineand got lucky - this jacket deserves all the good reviews, it fits me like aglove ( Large size, I am 6 foot ! 165 lbs, long arms)  Lots of pockets,feels very cozy, I could not be any more pleased..

MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Wind Warrior,5.0,"This coat has been a great tool for fighting winter weather in the Pacific Northwest. Freezing rain, fog, and snow don't stand a chance. I got this coat to be able to ride an ATV to plow snow and found it to be warm, comfortable, and easy to move in. It also provides a solid windproof barrier that I could tell was much better than my old parka. I can easily ride in freezing temperatures for hours at up to 30 mph - no problem.I got the ""Army Green"" and it seemed to be more like a split-pea green so I'll probably get another one in black and use it for the wet, dirty outdoor chores. Overall, very impressed. I'm 5'10"" and 150 lbs., so lean and mean but no problem with the fit. Sleeves might be a bit tight on popeye but there's plenty of room for you barrel-chested or beer-belly champions out there.The only thing that was a bit of a drawback was the hood, which runs a little small. Nothing a normal ballcap can't fill-in. Also, the zipper is a right-hand closure, so it might have been a mistake in the sewing process. I'd like to have had insulated pockets but they serve their purpose. Will definitely buy another one soon."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,"So I read a review that said this coat is for large people, they were right",4.0,"Brooklyn Review: I bought this coat because someone had written in their review that they were dissatisfied because this was  a coat for ""fat people."" I know I should have been outraged, but instead I realized that this was the coat for me. I have owned the coat for a few months now and it is wicked hot. The outer shell keeps out the rain and the cold. The light fleece on the inside makes me sweat. The price was worth it.So why not 5 stars?The problem is that the zippers are cheaply made. They look cool, but easily get jammed and fall off their track. I had to make a small stitch at the beginning and end of each pocket to prevent the zipper from falling off the track on all the pockets. Also, the fleece on the inside of my jacket had a section where the stitching came undone and I had to patch it up. Nothing crazy, but when you buy something new you don't expect to have to do some tailoring. The hood although still usable seems to run a little small, almost like it is out of proportion with the overall jacket.However, if the company can correct these three issues with a little more quality control and design checks this coat could easily sell for more and be a big hit. To the designer consider creating a female companion to this coat, but check the measurements for your intended consumer target."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Almost perfect,3.0,"I purchase 3 of these jackets, two for men (medium black camo, 2XL army green) and one for women (large black). Overall it is a good jacket but lacks one fundamental feature required to maintain body heat, a draw cord hem, without it, the body insulation that a good mountain snow jacket is supposed to provide, is gone. As simple as it sounds, sports such as downhill skiing, and snowboarding, expose the body to consistent winds, the body must remain insulated all the way around (cuffs, hem, neck, and face). These are the advantages, disadvantages, and other details of this garment.PROS:- The outer shell is relatively thick, the fabric feels sturdy and capable of handling abrasion.- The inner lining is very soft and comfortable, it is not as bulky as the Sherpa lining found in other Sherpa jackets but good enough.- The fibers of the inner lining are approximately 4mm long and allow reasonable airflow.- The inner lining of the hood fees comfortable, the hood provides a drawcord.- The cuffs can be adjusted to the wrist with velcros.- The men's medium size is true and it matches the dimensions provided by the manufacturer.- The women's large size is true and it matches the dimensions provided by the manufacturer.CONS:- The lack of a draw cord hem is a critical failure.- The zipper flap along the jacket should have snaps or velcros to prevent it from flapping around while under windy conditions, it has just two metal snaps, one close to the neck and one at the bottom of the hem.- The manufacturer does not specify, but the jacket appears to be 10000mm waterproof. 10K is enough to handle light to average rain for a short amount of time. Ratings between 10K and 15K can handle a moderate amount of rain for much longer, and jackets rated between 15K and 20K or higher are serious shells for heavy, intense rain over a prolonged period. This jacket will handle light rain but it is not a rain jacket.- The jacket is too stiff for rock climbing or cycling as advertised by the manufacturer.RECOMMENDATION:Other than the draw cord hem, it is a good jacket, but those that are looking to wear it for its advertised purpose (sports such as downhill skiing, and snowboarding) will find the draw cord to be a deal breaker, but if you don’t mind it or you can have one installed, then, it is a good product. In my case, I returned them because I plan on wearing them for sports activities under very windy conditions. There are similar products from different brands that include this detail."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Excellent,5.0,"Very impressed with the jacket. It came in two days of shipping and the packaging was very good. It’s light weight and surprisingly warm. I had my doubts, but so far it’s been a great jacket. We just got dumped on with a bunch of snow and I wore it with just my t-shirt underneath the jacket shoveling snow and it kept me warm. It was 25 degrees out by the way. But if you were not going to do any activities in it, I’d would wear a hoodie underneath it. Just for extra warmth. The sizing is right. I’m 5’6 and 170 pounds and the large fits really good with extra room for a hoodie comfortably. I washed it as soon as I got it. I washed it in cold water and dried it on low heat and it passed the test with no issues. It’s actually waterproof. Snow and rain didn’t penetrate the jacket at all. You can’t beat the price. I’m a very picky coat person and I do a lot of research before purchasing anything. I’m glad I went with this jacket. Overall, I’m just impressed with this jacket and would recommend it. Hope this helps."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Far exceeded expectations!,5.0,"Here are some details on this jacket's features, in order of importance.FIT: I am 5'7"", 143 lbs and usually order a men's ""small."" That's what I ordered and it fit me perfectly. It's roomy enough to layer a sweatshirt or heavy sweater underneath. My arms have a good range of motion in this jacket; it's not tight anywhere. It's longer than a bomber but not as long as a parka.WARMTH: This is an extremely warm, comfortable jacket. The pile (faux fur) lining is very effective. I've worn it in 25 degree weather so far, with a sweatshirt underneath and felt very snug. It has a zip-through collar that hugs your throat, keeping it protected.WATERPROOF: On two days when I walked my dog, it started raining. This jacket sheds water remarkably well. The rain just beaded up on the shell and ran off. I was very pleased with the rain protection quality.WINDPROOF:  The polyester fabric does an excellent job of blocking the wind. On cold, windy days, the wind chill didn't affect me at all.HOOD: A warm hood is a MUST here in the Midwest. This one features the same, ultra-warm pile lining as the jacket. We like to wear a stocking cap under the hood for complete warmth. This hood is plenty roomy for my thickest stocking cap. It has a hook-and-loop fastener 3/4"" wide by 2"" long. I don't know how this will hold up over time. It may be a bit skimpy. The hood has push-button toggles to tighten the string and hold it in place, much preferable to trying to tie a drawstring in cold weather.

That's what I ordered and it fit me perfectly. It's roomy enough to layer a sweatshirt or heavy sweater underneath. My arms have a good range of motion in this jacket; it's not tight anywhere. It's longer than a bomber but not as long as a parka.WARMTH: This is an extremely warm, comfortable jacket. The pile (faux fur) lining is very effective. I've worn it in 25 degree weather so far, with a sweatshirt underneath and felt very snug. It has a zip-through collar that hugs your throat, keeping it protected.WATERPROOF: On two days when I walked my dog, it started raining. This jacket sheds water remarkably well. The rain just beaded up on the shell and ran off. I was very pleased with the rain protection quality.WINDPROOF:  The polyester fabric does an excellent job of blocking the wind. On cold, windy days, the wind chill didn't affect me at all.HOOD: A warm hood is a MUST here in the Midwest. This one features the same, ultra-warm pile lining as the jacket. We like to wear a stocking cap under the hood for complete warmth. This hood is plenty roomy for my thickest stocking cap. It has a hook-and-loop fastener 3/4"" wide by 2"" long. I don't know how this will hold up over time. It may be a bit skimpy. The hood has push-button toggles to tighten the string and hold it in place, much preferable to trying to tie a drawstring in cold weather. The hood zips off, if you want to remove it.POCKETS: The two outside, bottom pockets have zippers. I don't know if that's necessary, but some folks may like them. I wear thick, insulated gloves and they easily fit in these deep pockets. The outside, left breast pocket measures 3.5"" wide by 7"" deep and is zippered. The inside pocket is 5.5"" wide by 7"" deep and zippered.CUFF CLOSURES: Each cuff has an exterior hook-and-loop closure to tighten the end of the sleeve. I haven't adjusted these because there's also some elastic inside the cuffs that keeps them tight around your wrist so wind doesn't blow in.DETAILS: On the outer right breast of the jacket is embroidered lettering that says: ""V.A. TOR 189  UNCO & BOROR"" with an embroidered logo. I have no idea what any of that means, but frankly, I don't care. This jacket is so warm and comfortable that I'm willing to overlook this mystery.OVERALL IMPRESSION: A completely superior product that far exceeded my expectations. If the nylon zipper holds up (and I have no reason to believe it won't; it works smoothly), I expect many years of good service from this jacket. Well, well worth the money."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Best coat ive owned,5.0,"This coat is amazing. It completely blocks the wind and rain. The coat is also very warm and fits perfect. I am 5'-9"" and 160lbs and it fits good with room for layers underneath if neededThe only negative i can think of is that the zippers seem a little cheap but so far they are holding up great.I was on the top of the Alps last week with just this coat, a long sleeve and a short sleave during a blizzard and was good to go"
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Better quality than Expected!,5.0,"Fits perfectly. As soon as I stepped out some one assumed it was a very expensive jacket. It keeps me extremely warm. The hood feels good on my head, it's removable and has a high quality velcro type strap plus strings. Pockets are accessible and convenient. It's not too big at all and is flexible with how you need to move about. so far so good."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Great jacket for cold & wet weather,5.0,"I bought this for my husband. He delivers gas for a living and in the winter it gets cold and wet. This jacket was perfect considering it was waterproof and warm, not to mention decently priced. He immediately tested its claim of being water proof. He put it on and stood in the shower. Definitely worth the money lmao"
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Get Fit and Function !,5.0,"I live in Houston where it can be very difficult to find a jacket, I went on lineand got lucky - this jacket deserves all the good reviews, it fits me like aglove ( Large size, I am 6 foot ! 165 lbs, long arms)  Lots of pockets,feels very cozy, I could not be any more pleased..  Thanks !"
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Well Done!,5.0,"Reviews for quality and size are accurate. I'm 5'9"" 175lbs and the large was very big on me even with a hoodie underneath. The medium fits perfect. I've only had it for a week and the quality is great so far. I got a compliment on the very first day."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Wind Warrior,5.0,"This coat has been a great tool for fighting winter weather in the Pacific Northwest. Freezing rain, fog, and snow don't stand a chance. I got this coat to be able to ride an ATV to plow snow and found it to be warm, comfortable, and easy to move in. It also provides a solid windproof barrier that I could tell was much better than my old parka. I can easily ride in freezing temperatures for hours at up to 30 mph - no problem.I got the ""Army Green"" and it seemed to be more like a split-pea green so I'll probably get another one in black and use it for the wet, dirty outdoor chores. Overall, very impressed. I'm 5'10"" and 150 lbs., so lean and mean but no problem with the fit. Sleeves might be a bit tight on popeye but there's plenty of room for you barrel-chested or beer-belly champions out there.The only thing that was a bit of a drawback was the hood, which runs a little small. Nothing a normal ballcap can't fill-in. Also, the zipper is a right-hand closure, so it might have been a mistake in the sewing process. I'd like to have had insulated pockets but they serve their purpose. Will definitely buy another one soon."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,"So I read a review that said this coat is for large people, they were right",4.0,"Brooklyn Review: I bought this coat because someone had written in their review that they were dissatisfied because this was  a coat for ""fat people."" I know I should have been outraged, but instead I realized that this was the coat for me. I have owned the coat for a few months now and it is wicked hot. The outer shell keeps out the rain and the cold. The light fleece on the inside makes me sweat. The price was worth it.So why not 5 stars?The problem is that the zippers are cheaply made. They look cool, but easily get jammed and fall off their track. I had to make a small stitch at the beginning and end of each pocket to prevent the zipper from falling off the track on all the pockets. Also, the fleece on the inside of my jacket had a section where the stitching came undone and I had to patch it up. Nothing crazy, but when you buy something new you don't expect to have to do some tailoring. The hood although still usable seems to run a little small, almost like it is out of proportion with the overall jacket.However, if the company can correct these three issues with a little more quality control and design checks this coat could easily sell for more and be a big hit. To the designer consider creating a female companion to this coat, but check the measurements for your intended consumer target."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Almost perfect,3.0,"I purchase 3 of these jackets, two for men (medium black camo, 2XL army green) and one for women (large black). Overall it is a good jacket but lacks one fundamental feature required to maintain body heat, a draw cord hem, without it, the body insulation that a good mountain snow jacket is supposed to provide, is gone. As simple as it sounds, sports such as downhill skiing, and snowboarding, expose the body to consistent winds, the body must remain insulated all the way around (cuffs, hem, neck, and face). These are the advantages, disadvantages, and other details of this garment.PROS:- The outer shell is relatively thick, the fabric feels sturdy and capable of handling abrasion.- The inner lining is very soft and comfortable, it is not as bulky as the Sherpa lining found in other Sherpa jackets but good enough.- The fibers of the inner lining are approximately 4mm long and allow reasonable airflow.- The inner lining of the hood fees comfortable, the hood provides a drawcord.- The cuffs can be adjusted to the wrist with velcros.- The men's medium size is true and it matches the dimensions provided by the manufacturer.- The women's large size is true and it matches the dimensions provided by the manufacturer.CONS:- The lack of a draw cord hem is a critical failure.- The zipper flap along the jacket should have snaps or velcros to prevent it from flapping around while under windy conditions, it has just two metal snaps, one close to the neck and one at the bottom of the hem.- The manufacturer does not specify, but the jacket appears to be 10000mm waterproof. 10K is enough to handle light to average rain for a short amount of time. Ratings between 10K and 15K can handle a moderate amount of rain for much longer, and jackets rated between 15K and 20K or higher are serious shells for heavy, intense rain over a prolonged period. This jacket will handle light rain but it is not a rain jacket.- The jacket is too stiff for rock climbing or cycling as advertised by the manufacturer.RECOMMENDATION:Other than the draw cord hem, it is a good jacket, but those that are looking to wear it for its advertised purpose (sports such as downhill skiing, and snowboarding) will find the draw cord to be a deal breaker, but if you don’t mind it or you can have one installed, then, it is a good product. In my case, I returned them because I plan on wearing them for sports activities under very windy conditions. There are similar products from different brands that include this detail."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Excellent,5.0,"Very impressed with the jacket. It came in two days of shipping and the packaging was very good. It’s light weight and surprisingly warm. I had my doubts, but so far it’s been a great jacket. We just got dumped on with a bunch of snow and I wore it with just my t-shirt underneath the jacket shoveling snow and it kept me warm. It was 25 degrees out by the way. But if you were not going to do any activities in it, I’d would wear a hoodie underneath it. Just for extra warmth. The sizing is right. I’m 5’6 and 170 pounds and the large fits really good with extra room for a hoodie comfortably. I washed it as soon as I got it. I washed it in cold water and dried it on low heat and it passed the test with no issues. It’s actually waterproof. Snow and rain didn’t penetrate the jacket at all. You can’t beat the price. I’m a very picky coat person and I do a lot of research before purchasing anything. I’m glad I went with this jacket. Overall, I’m just impressed with this jacket and would recommend it. Hope this helps."

MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Excellent,5.0,"Very impressed with the jacket. It came in two days of shipping and the packaging was very good. It’s light weight and surprisingly warm. I had my doubts, but so far it’s been a great jacket. We just got dumped on with a bunch of snow and I wore it with just my t-shirt underneath the jacket shoveling snow and it kept me warm. It was 25 degrees out by the way. But if you were not going to do any activities in it, I’d would wear a hoodie underneath it. Just for extra warmth. The sizing is right. I’m 5’6 and 170 pounds and the large fits really good with extra room for a hoodie comfortably. I washed it as soon as I got it. I washed it in cold water and dried it on low heat and it passed the test with no issues. It’s actually waterproof. Snow and rain didn’t penetrate the jacket at all. You can’t beat the price. I’m a very picky coat person and I do a lot of research before purchasing anything. I’m glad I went with this jacket. Overall, I’m just impressed with this jacket and would recommend it. Hope this helps."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Far exceeded expectations!,5.0,"Here are some details on this jacket's features, in order of importance.FIT: I am 5'7"", 143 lbs and usually order a men's ""small."" That's what I ordered and it fit me perfectly. It's roomy enough to layer a sweatshirt or heavy sweater underneath. My arms have a good range of motion in this jacket; it's not tight anywhere. It's longer than a bomber but not as long as a parka.WARMTH: This is an extremely warm, comfortable jacket. The pile (faux fur) lining is very effective. I've worn it in 25 degree weather so far, with a sweatshirt underneath and felt very snug. It has a zip-through collar that hugs your throat, keeping it protected.WATERPROOF: On two days when I walked my dog, it started raining. This jacket sheds water remarkably well. The rain just beaded up on the shell and ran off. I was very pleased with the rain protection quality.WINDPROOF:  The polyester fabric does an excellent job of blocking the wind. On cold, windy days, the wind chill didn't affect me at all.HOOD: A warm hood is a MUST here in the Midwest. This one features the same, ultra-warm pile lining as the jacket. We like to wear a stocking cap under the hood for complete warmth. This hood is plenty roomy for my thickest stocking cap. It has a hook-and-loop fastener 3/4"" wide by 2"" long. I don't know how this will hold up over time. It may be a bit skimpy. The hood has push-button toggles to tighten the string and hold it in place, much preferable to trying to tie a drawstring in cold weather. The hood zips off, if you want to remove it.POCKETS: The two outside, bottom pockets have zippers. I don't know if that's necessary, but some folks may like them. I wear thick, insulated gloves and they easily fit in these deep pockets. The outside, left breast pocket measures 3.5"" wide by 7"" deep and is zippered. The inside pocket is 5.5"" wide by 7"" deep and zippered.CUFF CLOSURES: Each cuff has an exterior hook-and-loop closure to tighten the end of the sleeve. I haven't adjusted these because there's also some elastic inside the cuffs that keeps them tight around your wrist so wind doesn't blow in.DETAILS: On the outer right breast of the jacket is embroidered lettering that says: ""V.A. TOR 189  UNCO & BOROR"" with an embroidered logo. I have no idea what any of that means, but frankly, I don't care. This jacket is so warm and comfortable that I'm willing to overlook this mystery.OVERALL IMPRESSION: A completely superior product that far exceeded my expectations. If the nylon zipper holds up (and I have no reason to believe it won't; it works smoothly), I expect many years of good service from this jacket. Well, well worth the money."

MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Wind Warrior,5.0,"This coat has been a great tool for fighting winter weather in the Pacific Northwest. Freezing rain, fog, and snow don't stand a chance. I got this coat to be able to ride an ATV to plow snow and found it to be warm, comfortable, and easy to move in. It also provides a solid windproof barrier that I could tell was much better than my old parka. I can easily ride in freezing temperatures for hours at up to 30 mph - no problem.I got the ""Army Green"" and it seemed to be more like a split-pea green so I'll probably get another one in black and use it for the wet, dirty outdoor chores. Overall, very impressed. I'm 5'10"" and 150 lbs., so lean and mean but no problem with the fit. Sleeves might be a bit tight on popeye but there's plenty of room for you barrel-chested or beer-belly champions out there.The only thing that was a bit of a drawback was the hood, which runs a little small. Nothing a normal ballcap can't fill-in. Also, the zipper is a right-hand closure, so it might have been a mistake in the sewing process. I'd like to have had insulated pockets but they serve their purpose. Will definitely buy another one soon."

I know I should have been outraged, but instead I realized that this was the coat for me. I have owned the coat for a few months now and it is wicked hot. The outer shell keeps out the rain and the cold. The light fleece on the inside makes me sweat. The price was worth it.So why not 5 stars?The problem is that the zippers are cheaply made. They look cool, but easily get jammed and fall off their track. I had to make a small stitch at the beginning and end of each pocket to prevent the zipper from falling off the track on all the pockets. Also, the fleece on the inside of my jacket had a section where the stitching came undone and I had to patch it up. Nothing crazy, but when you buy something new you don't expect to have to do some tailoring. The hood although still usable seems to run a little small, almost like it is out of proportion with the overall jacket.However, if the company can correct these three issues with a little more quality control and design checks this coat could easily sell for more and be a big hit. To the designer consider creating a female companion to this coat, but check the measurements for your intended consumer target."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Almost perfect,3.0,"I purchase 3 of these jackets, two for men (medium black camo, 2XL army green) and one for women (large black). Overall it is a good jacket but lacks one fundamental feature required to maintain body heat, a draw cord hem, without it, the body insulation that a good mountain snow jacket is supposed to provide, is gone. As simple as it sounds, sports such as downhill skiing, and snowboarding, expose the body to consistent winds, the body must remain insulated all the way around (cuffs, hem, neck, and face). These are the advantages, disadvantages, and other details of this garment.PROS:- The outer shell is relatively thick, the fabric feels sturdy and capable of handling abrasion.- The inner lining is very soft and comfortable, it is not as bulky as the Sherpa lining found in other Sherpa jackets but good enough.- The fibers of the inner lining are approximately 4mm long and allow reasonable airflow.- The inner lining of the hood fees comfortable, the hood provides a drawcord.- The cuffs can be adjusted to the wrist with velcros.- The men's medium size is true and it matches the dimensions provided by the manufacturer.- The women's large size is true and it matches the dimensions provided by the manufacturer.CONS:- The lack of a draw cord hem is a critical failure.- The zipper flap along the jacket should have snaps or velcros to prevent it from flapping around while under windy conditions, it has just two metal snaps, one close to the neck and one at the bottom of the hem.- The manufacturer does not specify, but the jacket appears to be 10000mm waterproof. 10K is enough to handle light to average rain for a short amount of time. Ratings between 10K and 15K can handle a moderate amount of rain for much longer, and jackets rated between 15K and 20K or higher are serious shells for heavy, intense rain over a prolonged period.

These are the advantages, disadvantages, and other details of this garment.PROS:- The outer shell is relatively thick, the fabric feels sturdy and capable of handling abrasion.- The inner lining is very soft and comfortable, it is not as bulky as the Sherpa lining found in other Sherpa jackets but good enough.- The fibers of the inner lining are approximately 4mm long and allow reasonable airflow.- The inner lining of the hood fees comfortable, the hood provides a drawcord.- The cuffs can be adjusted to the wrist with velcros.- The men's medium size is true and it matches the dimensions provided by the manufacturer.- The women's large size is true and it matches the dimensions provided by the manufacturer.CONS:- The lack of a draw cord hem is a critical failure.- The zipper flap along the jacket should have snaps or velcros to prevent it from flapping around while under windy conditions, it has just two metal snaps, one close to the neck and one at the bottom of the hem.- The manufacturer does not specify, but the jacket appears to be 10000mm waterproof. 10K is enough to handle light to average rain for a short amount of time. Ratings between 10K and 15K can handle a moderate amount of rain for much longer, and jackets rated between 15K and 20K or higher are serious shells for heavy, intense rain over a prolonged period. This jacket will handle light rain but it is not a rain jacket.- The jacket is too stiff for rock climbing or cycling as advertised by the manufacturer.RECOMMENDATION:Other than the draw cord hem, it is a good jacket, but those that are looking to wear it for its advertised purpose (sports such as downhill skiing, and snowboarding) will find the draw cord to be a deal breaker, but if you don’t mind it or you can have one installed, then, it is a good product. In my case, I returned them because I plan on wearing them for sports activities under very windy conditions. There are similar products from different brands that include this detail."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Excellent,5.0,"Very impressed with the jacket. It came in two days of shipping and the packaging was very good. It’s light weight and surprisingly warm. I had my doubts, but so far it’s been a great jacket. We just got dumped on with a bunch of snow and I wore it with just my t-shirt underneath the jacket shoveling snow and it kept me warm. It was 25 degrees out by the way. But if you were not going to do any activities in it, I’d would wear a hoodie underneath it. Just for extra warmth. The sizing is right. I’m 5’6 and 170 pounds and the large fits really good with extra room for a hoodie comfortably. I washed it as soon as I got it. I washed it in cold water and dried it on low heat and it passed the test with no issues. It’s actually waterproof. Snow and rain didn’t penetrate the jacket at all. You can’t beat the price. I’m a very picky coat person and I do a lot of research before purchasing anything. I’m glad I went with this jacket. Overall, I’m just impressed with this jacket and would recommend it. Hope this helps."
MOERDENG Men's Waterproof Ski Jacket Warm Winter Snow Coat Mountain Windbreaker Hooded Raincoat,Far exceeded expectations!,5.0,"Here are some details on this jacket's features, in order of importance.FIT: I am 5'7"", 143 lbs and usually order a men's ""small."" That's what I ordered and it fit me perfectly. It's roomy enough to layer a sweatshirt or heavy sweater underneath. My arms have a good range of motion in this jacket; it's not tight anywhere. It's longer than a bomber but not as long as a parka.WARMTH: This is an extremely warm, comfortable jacket. The pile (faux fur) lining is very effective. I've worn it in 25 degree weather so far, with a sweatshirt underneath and felt very snug. It has a zip-through collar that hugs your throat, keeping it protected.WATERPROOF: On two days when I walked my dog, it started raining. This jacket sheds water remarkably well. The rain just beaded up on the shell and ran off. I was very pleased with the rain protection quality.WINDPROOF:  The polyester fabric does an excellent job of blocking the wind. On cold, windy days, the wind chill didn't affect me at all.HOOD: A warm hood is a MUST here in the Midwest. This one features the same, ultra-warm pile lining as the jacket. We like to wear a stocking cap under the hood for complete warmth. This hood is plenty roomy for my thickest stocking cap. It has a hook-and-loop fastener 3/4"" wide by 2"" long. I don't know how this will hold up over time. It may be a bit skimpy. The hood has push-button toggles to tighten the string and hold it in place, much preferable to trying to tie a drawstring in cold weather. The hood zips off, if you want to remove it.POCKETS: The two outside, bottom pockets have zippers. I don't know if that's necessary, but some folks may like them. I wear thick, insulated gloves and they easily fit in these deep pockets. The outside, left breast pocket measures 3.5"" wide by 7"" deep and is zippered. The inside pocket is 5.5"" wide by 7"" deep and zippered.CUFF CLOSURES: Each cuff has an exterior hook-and-loop closure to tighten the end of the sleeve. I haven't adjusted these because there's also some elastic inside the cuffs that keeps them tight around your wrist so wind doesn't blow in.DETAILS: On the outer right breast of the jacket is embroidered lettering that says: ""V.A. TOR 189  UNCO & BOROR"" with an embroidered logo. I have no idea what any of that means, but frankly, I don't care. This jacket is so warm and comfortable that I'm willing to overlook this mystery.OVERALL IMPRESSION: A completely superior product that far exceeded my expectations. If the nylon zipper holds up (and I have no reason to believe it won't; it works smoothly), I expect many years of good service from this jacket. Well, well worth the money."
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Runs big. Rocks hard.,5.0,"This jacket has changed the way I look at life. Can a jacket do that? You bet your sweet bippy.I bought this baby to keep me safe from a puppy who was bitey as all hell and loved to frolic in mud and poop. To say the least I needed something bulletproof.This jacket is not bulletproof.But puppy proof for sure. It’s also pretty wind, rain, snow, nip and slip proof.Gusseted arms allow for a solid range of motion. So quick movements are a piece of cake.Jacket doesn’t come with cake.But the new lease on life comes with its ability to be warm when you need warm and not too warm when you don’t. I’ve worn it in 20 degree weather and 60 degree weather without issue. All I changed was the layering. Sherpa interiors for the win.This jacket doesn’t come with Tenzig Norgay.Size wise, this mono-colored dream coat runs big. I’m a shorter fella with a fairly slim frame and I’m rolling in a small. It’s a hair on the short side. But a medium made me feel like I was wearing a circus tent.This jacket doesn’t come with a circus.My faith in inexpensive clothing restored, I recommend this jacket to anyone who needs a jacket to go outside.  If you’re the type to wear a jacket inside, it’s a little bulky for that. And definitely too much jacket for sleeping.This jacket is the only two season jacket you’ll ever need. Unless you need something different, you know, for a nice night out or a formal event like a wedding. It does come in black, but I imagine the your suit jacket would poke out the bottom.That would be a faux pas.I hope you enjoy it as much as I do."
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),"Love the jacket, but the medium was just barely too small",5.0,"I ordered the large and medium. The large was a little big. The medium seemingly fit great, it looked really good on me, but it was a little tight around the armpits, especially with a hoodie on under it. Since I bought this jacket for working outside I kept the large so I could be comfy. I'm 5'11"", 175lbs with a 41"" chest. Hope this helps someone."
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Fits great. Love it.,5.0,"Wow. A jacket that actually fits me. Amazing. The sleeves are perfect. Normally when I reach out, or over my head, the sleeve will come half way to my elbow, but these are perfect. The flaps cut in the shoulders allow for a much wider range of motion which is exactly what I need from a work jacket.I'm an aircraft maintenance tech and work outside on the flight where its cold and windy, so the extra long tail and inner cuffs in the sleeves are great for keeping the draft off my back. I'm not a huge fan of hoods, BUT, the extra material around the neck does the keep out. Also, it's very warm, but not overly bulky, which great for climbing in out of confined spaces.Overall,  I've been extremely happy with almost everything Carhartt has put, and this is no exception."

Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Great coat Awesome buy no regrets.,5.0,"I love ❤️ it omg I bought so many jackets trying to find the right fit, we'll this jacket is high quality you can't go wrong. I bought a 2x for my Wife she's 5/11 at 120 pounds. She has a little belly in front, but it fit perfectly over it, with a little extra room, . I also bought one for me a 3x. I'm 5feet 6inches, & 270lbs. The coat fits perfectly. Now if I wanted to wear my wife's coat I could get a way with a 2x but I wouldn't have a whole lot of room for gaining weight or and extra sweat shot under my coat if I bought the 2x. But with the 3x I could where a wears hit under the 3x no problem. The 2x would be just a little tight especially if I'm bloated. Nonetheless is an awesome coat an awesome buy. I absolutely love it and she loves hers."

Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Great minus cuffs,5.0,So I tried on a xxl before ordering this xl. I tried the xxl the only size available at a local store to know if I needed a xl or xxl based off how that fit.. now the Xxl was huge on me imo. The xlarge fits perfect. Enough room for a hoodie but without one also not super big just the right size.Only thing I dislike is the sleeve cuffs there super tight. Now the movement is excellent in this jacket over a active jacket especially for work usage. But the cuffs are a bit much def won’t get a draft in the sleeve.The Sherpa liner is nice and warm.. I doubt I’ll wear this much to break it in before warmer weather is here fully. But never know.All and all it’s a great jacket if your looking for a better looking less work looking jacket for going out but still need that carhartt quality for your money.

The flaps cut in the shoulders allow for a much wider range of motion which is exactly what I need from a work jacket.I'm an aircraft maintenance tech and work outside on the flight where its cold and windy, so the extra long tail and inner cuffs in the sleeves are great for keeping the draft off my back. I'm not a huge fan of hoods, BUT, the extra material around the neck does the keep out. Also, it's very warm, but not overly bulky, which great for climbing in out of confined spaces.Overall,  I've been extremely happy with almost everything Carhartt has put, and this is no exception."

Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),"Get the ""medium tall"" if ur slim and tall enough for a Large but not fat enough~!",5.0,"I am 5’11” , 180 lbs. slim, no gut yet.I got the medium size it seems a bit tight in the shoulder and short on the arms. I got the large too as size comp. It had longer arms  which was perfect  and more space in the shoulder. it was a longer skirt too but added many inches around the waist. cold air would come in even with a hoodie on under it and it  was really baggy at the stomach when sitting, i had to wear 2 sweatshirts to fill it out. So Get the medium tall and it fits perfect. It has longer arms and wider sholder when i move the wrist collars stay put allows for more motion. and a longer skirt at  The waist. size is the same as the medium waist but there’s more room in this coat and stays tailor to body.  I have had the previous version if this coat for 12 years and the medium tall is like the old medium from way back."
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Rugged waist-length jacket,3.0,"Returning this jacket in size 2XLT. Carhartt B & T sizing seems all over the place. The Bartlett is more generously cut than other 2019 release B & T Carhartt jackets, but smaller than previous season's. It is a waist-length jacket. On black, Carhartt logo tag is not black as pictured. Weird surprise: stretch band on sleeves have blood pressure cuff levels of compression on wrists. If you wear a large watch or are big-boned, this could be uncomfortable."
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Carthart review,5.0,"I thought I’d give the carthart jacket a try moving from the south to the north.I ABSOLUTELY love the jacket so much that I bought the black one also.I work outdoors and it has come in very handy.The range of motion for it is perfect. It fits just perfect. You don’t feel the wind cutting through you and when it rains or snows it keeps you dry.The quality is amazing and I highly recommend it for anyone that works outdoors and wants great quality, durability and warmth"
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Great coat Awesome buy no regrets.,5.0,"I love ❤️ it omg I bought so many jackets trying to find the right fit, we'll this jacket is high quality you can't go wrong. I bought a 2x for my Wife she's 5/11 at 120 pounds. She has a little belly in front, but it fit perfectly over it, with a little extra room, . I also bought one for me a 3x. I'm 5feet 6inches, & 270lbs. The coat fits perfectly. Now if I wanted to wear my wife's coat I could get a way with a 2x but I wouldn't have a whole lot of room for gaining weight or and extra sweat shot under my coat if I bought the 2x. But with the 3x I could where a wears hit under the 3x no problem. The 2x would be just a little tight especially if I'm bloated. Nonetheless is an awesome coat an awesome buy. I absolutely love it and she loves hers."
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),IMO Runs larger than expected,3.0,"I like the jacket, its thicker that what it looks like on the model in the pic.  I wear everything in a Large, tshirst, work shirts and jacket and nicer dress shirts.  This run larger than a Large, I could wear a hoodie under this and still fit loosely.  Im gonna order a medium and then try it on and return one of them."
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Great minus cuffs,5.0,So I tried on a xxl before ordering this xl. I tried the xxl the only size available at a local store to know if I needed a xl or xxl based off how that fit.. now the Xxl was huge on me imo. The xlarge fits perfect. Enough room for a hoodie but without one also not super big just the right size.Only thing I dislike is the sleeve cuffs there super tight. Now the movement is excellent in this jacket over a active jacket especially for work usage. But the cuffs are a bit much def won’t get a draft in the sleeve.The Sherpa liner is nice and warm.. I doubt I’ll wear this much to break it in before warmer weather is here fully. But never know.All and all it’s a great jacket if your looking for a better looking less work looking jacket for going out but still need that carhartt quality for your money.
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Runs big. Rocks hard.,5.0,"This jacket has changed the way I look at life. Can a jacket do that? You bet your sweet bippy.I bought this baby to keep me safe from a puppy who was bitey as all hell and loved to frolic in mud and poop. To say the least I needed something bulletproof.This jacket is not bulletproof.But puppy proof for sure. It’s also pretty wind, rain, snow, nip and slip proof.Gusseted arms allow for a solid range of motion. So quick movements are a piece of cake.Jacket doesn’t come with cake.But the new lease on life comes with its ability to be warm when you need warm and not too warm when you don’t. I’ve worn it in 20 degree weather and 60 degree weather without issue. All I changed was the layering. Sherpa interiors for the win.This jacket doesn’t come with Tenzig Norgay.Size wise, this mono-colored dream coat runs big. I’m a shorter fella with a fairly slim frame and I’m rolling in a small. It’s a hair on the short side. But a medium made me feel like I was wearing a circus tent.This jacket doesn’t come with a circus.My faith in inexpensive clothing restored, I recommend this jacket to anyone who needs a jacket to go outside.  If you’re the type to wear a jacket inside, it’s a little bulky for that. And definitely too much jacket for sleeping.This jacket is the only two season jacket you’ll ever need. Unless you need something different, you know, for a nice night out or a formal event like a wedding. It does come in black, but I imagine the your suit jacket would poke out the bottom.That would be a faux pas.I hope you enjoy it as much as I do."

I got the large too as size comp. It had longer arms  which was perfect  and more space in the shoulder. it was a longer skirt too but added many inches around the waist. cold air would come in even with a hoodie on under it and it  was really baggy at the stomach when sitting, i had to wear 2 sweatshirts to fill it out.

Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Rugged waist-length jacket,3.0,"Returning this jacket in size 2XLT. Carhartt B & T sizing seems all over the place. The Bartlett is more generously cut than other 2019 release B & T Carhartt jackets, but smaller than previous season's. It is a waist-length jacket. On black, Carhartt logo tag is not black as pictured. Weird surprise: stretch band on sleeves have blood pressure cuff levels of compression on wrists.

Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Carthart review,5.0,"I thought I’d give the carthart jacket a try moving from the south to the north.I ABSOLUTELY love the jacket so much that I bought the black one also.I work outdoors and it has come in very handy.The range of motion for it is perfect. It fits just perfect. You don’t feel the wind cutting through you and when it rains or snows it keeps you dry.The quality is amazing and I highly recommend it for anyone that works outdoors and wants great quality, durability and warmth"
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Great coat Awesome buy no regrets.,5.0,"I love ❤️ it omg I bought so many jackets trying to find the right fit, we'll this jacket is high quality you can't go wrong. I bought a 2x for my Wife she's 5/11 at 120 pounds. She has a little belly in front, but it fit perfectly over it, with a little extra room, . I also bought one for me a 3x. I'm 5feet 6inches, & 270lbs. The coat fits perfectly. Now if I wanted to wear my wife's coat I could get a way with a 2x but I wouldn't have a whole lot of room for gaining weight or and extra sweat shot under my coat if I bought the 2x. But with the 3x I could where a wears hit under the 3x no problem. The 2x would be just a little tight especially if I'm bloated. Nonetheless is an awesome coat an awesome buy. I absolutely love it and she loves hers."
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),IMO Runs larger than expected,3.0,"I like the jacket, its thicker that what it looks like on the model in the pic.  I wear everything in a Large, tshirst, work shirts and jacket and nicer dress shirts.  This run larger than a Large, I could wear a hoodie under this and still fit loosely.  Im gonna order a medium and then try it on and return one of them."
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Great minus cuffs,5.0,So I tried on a xxl before ordering this xl. I tried the xxl the only size available at a local store to know if I needed a xl or xxl based off how that fit.. now the Xxl was huge on me imo. The xlarge fits perfect. Enough room for a hoodie but without one also not super big just the right size.Only thing I dislike is the sleeve cuffs there super tight. Now the movement is excellent in this jacket over a active jacket especially for work usage. But the cuffs are a bit much def won’t get a draft in the sleeve.The Sherpa liner is nice and warm.. I doubt I’ll wear this much to break it in before warmer weather is here fully. But never know.All and all it’s a great jacket if your looking for a better looking less work looking jacket for going out but still need that carhartt quality for your money.
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Runs big. Rocks hard.,5.0,"This jacket has changed the way I look at life. Can a jacket do that? You bet your sweet bippy.I bought this baby to keep me safe from a puppy who was bitey as all hell and loved to frolic in mud and poop. To say the least I needed something bulletproof.This jacket is not bulletproof.But puppy proof for sure. It’s also pretty wind, rain, snow, nip and slip proof.Gusseted arms allow for a solid range of motion. So quick movements are a piece of cake.Jacket doesn’t come with cake.But the new lease on life comes with its ability to be warm when you need warm and not too warm when you don’t. I’ve worn it in 20 degree weather and 60 degree weather without issue. All I changed was the layering. Sherpa interiors for the win.This jacket doesn’t come with Tenzig Norgay.Size wise, this mono-colored dream coat runs big. I’m a shorter fella with a fairly slim frame and I’m rolling in a small. It’s a hair on the short side. But a medium made me feel like I was wearing a circus tent.This jacket doesn’t come with a circus.My faith in inexpensive clothing restored, I recommend this jacket to anyone who needs a jacket to go outside.  If you’re the type to wear a jacket inside, it’s a little bulky for that. And definitely too much jacket for sleeping.This jacket is the only two season jacket you’ll ever need. Unless you need something different, you know, for a nice night out or a formal event like a wedding. It does come in black, but I imagine the your suit jacket would poke out the bottom.That would be a faux pas.I hope you enjoy it as much as I do."

It fits just perfect.

Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Great coat Awesome buy no regrets.,5.0,"I love ❤️ it omg I bought so many jackets trying to find the right fit, we'll this jacket is high quality you can't go wrong. I bought a 2x for my Wife she's 5/11 at 120 pounds. She has a little belly in front, but it fit perfectly over it, with a little extra room, . I also bought one for me a 3x. I'm 5feet 6inches, & 270lbs. The coat fits perfectly. Now if I wanted to wear my wife's coat I could get a way with a 2x but I wouldn't have a whole lot of room for gaining weight or and extra sweat shot under my coat if I bought the 2x. But with the 3x I could where a wears hit under the 3x no problem. The 2x would be just a little tight especially if I'm bloated. Nonetheless is an awesome coat an awesome buy. I absolutely love it and she loves hers."

Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Great minus cuffs,5.0,So I tried on a xxl before ordering this xl. I tried the xxl the only size available at a local store to know if I needed a xl or xxl based off how that fit.. now the Xxl was huge on me imo. The xlarge fits perfect. Enough room for a hoodie but without one also not super big just the right size.Only thing I dislike is the sleeve cuffs there super tight. Now the movement is excellent in this jacket over a active jacket especially for work usage. But the cuffs are a bit much def won’t get a draft in the sleeve.The Sherpa liner is nice and warm.. I doubt I’ll wear this much to break it in before warmer weather is here fully. But never know.All and all it’s a great jacket if your looking for a better looking less work looking jacket for going out but still need that carhartt quality for your money.
Carhartt Men's Bartlett Jacket (Regular and Big & Tall Sizes),Runs big. Rocks hard.,5.0,"This jacket has changed the way I look at life. Can a jacket do that? You bet your sweet bippy.I bought this baby to keep me safe from a puppy who was bitey as all hell and loved to frolic in mud and poop. To say the least I needed something bulletproof.This jacket is not bulletproof.But puppy proof for sure. It’s also pretty wind, rain, snow, nip and slip proof.Gusseted arms allow for a solid range of motion. So quick movements are a piece of cake.Jacket doesn’t come with cake.But the new lease on life comes with its ability to be warm when you need warm and not too warm when you don’t. I’ve worn it in 20 degree weather and 60 degree weather without issue. All I changed was the layering. Sherpa interiors for the win.This jacket doesn’t come with Tenzig Norgay.Size wise, this mono-colored dream coat runs big. I’m a shorter fella with a fairly slim frame and I’m rolling in a small. It’s a hair on the short side. But a medium made me feel like I was wearing a circus tent.This jacket doesn’t come with a circus.My faith in inexpensive clothing restored, I recommend this jacket to anyone who needs a jacket to go outside.  If you’re the type to wear a jacket inside, it’s a little bulky for that. And definitely too much jacket for sleeping.This jacket is the only two season jacket you’ll ever need. Unless you need something different, you know, for a nice night out or a formal event like a wedding. It does come in black, but I imagine the your suit jacket would poke out the bottom.That would be a faux pas.I hope you enjoy it as much as I do."

Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket, Charcoal, XL

   because the product description CLEARLY states that the jacket is ""WATERPROOF"".When the jacket arrived, I opened the package and found a tag CLEARLY stating that the jacket is ""WATER RESISTANT"".I ordered an XL which fit fine, but I have no idea if the jacket is warm because I didn't bother to try it out before I sent it back!!!I for one don't like to be lied to!!Also, If color matters to you Tommy Hilfiger's idea of ""Charcoal"" is far different than mine!! Charcoal is dark gray/black, the jacket I was sent was blue.This is a clear case of Product Misrepresentation!"
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket,NOT WATERPROOF AS STATED!,1.0,"Item description clearly states WATERPROOF, tag on delivered item clearly states WATER RESISTANT ........... those are two very different things!"
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket,Not waterproof,2.0,"Pretty nice, thin jacket. The hood is HUGE. Like, I can't see when it's up. I need to wear a hat under the hood when it's raining which is annoying. And, of course, it's not waterproof like the description says it is. It clear says it's ""water resistant"" on the tag. Big difference. Of course, I know there are really no jackets this lightweight that are truly waterproof, but overall disappointing. For a water resistant jacket, it's pretty nice, if you don't have to put the hood up. I get hot easily, and this one seems fairly cool."
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket,Nice jacket for price,4.0,"I am a tall female so i usually wear mens jackets for the arm length and upper body length.

The length comes to middle of butt."
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket,Very nice for the money,4.0,"I'm 5'7"", 155 pounds and a small fit perfectly. It's comfortable and perfect over a sweater/t-shirt combo. Nice hood with a drawstring and includes a drawstring around the waist to keep wind from blowing under.My only problem is that the zipper jams a lot. However, I had a nearly identical Columbia jacket that I lost and this one is nicer even with the troublesome zipper. Nicer lining, better fit, and a little better looking IMO.It's not waterproof - duh, you don't get waterproof for $50 - but it will keep you reasonably dry if you're briefly in light rain as I often am (I live in a city neighborhood and my car is usually a short walk to a public parking space).I live in Chicago where you get lots of variable weather and this jacket is perfect for the in-between seasons when the temp varies from 40 to 60 degrees."

It took only the second use of this jacket, for an unintentional slight tug on the jacket (while hanging on a hook by that loop), for the loop to break... which makes me think, that it's a (literal) jacket maker ""loophole"" conspiracy, that all these loops are meant to easily break and frustrate the jacket owner.

   because the product description CLEARLY states that the jacket is ""WATERPROOF"".When the jacket arrived, I opened the package and found a tag CLEARLY stating that the jacket is ""WATER RESISTANT"".I ordered an XL which fit fine, but I have no idea if the jacket is warm because I didn't bother to try it out before I sent it back!!!I for one don't like to be lied to!!Also, If color matters to you Tommy Hilfiger's idea of ""Charcoal"" is far different than mine!! Charcoal is dark gray/black, the jacket I was sent was blue.This is a clear case of Product Misrepresentation!"
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket,NOT WATERPROOF AS STATED!,1.0,"Item description clearly states WATERPROOF, tag on delivered item clearly states WATER RESISTANT ........... those are two very different things!"
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket,Not waterproof,2.0,"Pretty nice, thin jacket. The hood is HUGE. Like, I can't see when it's up. I need to wear a hat under the hood when it's raining which is annoying. And, of course, it's not waterproof like the description says it is. It clear says it's ""water resistant"" on the tag. Big difference. Of course, I know there are really no jackets this lightweight that are truly waterproof, but overall disappointing. For a water resistant jacket, it's pretty nice, if you don't have to put the hood up. I get hot easily, and this one seems fairly cool."
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket,Nice jacket for price,4.0,"I am a tall female so i usually wear mens jackets for the arm length and upper body length. I ordered a medium and im glad I did. (5""9 weigh 140) The fit was roomy not tight but the jacket is thin.  I didnt want a puffer or bulky coat. This jacket is good for layering underneath. The length comes to middle of butt."
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket,Very nice for the money,4.0,"I'm 5'7"", 155 pounds and a small fit perfectly. It's comfortable and perfect over a sweater/t-shirt combo. Nice hood with a drawstring and includes a drawstring around the waist to keep wind from blowing under.My only problem is that the zipper jams a lot. However, I had a nearly identical Columbia jacket that I lost and this one is nicer even with the troublesome zipper. Nicer lining, better fit, and a little better looking IMO.It's not waterproof - duh, you don't get waterproof for $50 - but it will keep you reasonably dry if you're briefly in light rain as I often am (I live in a city neighborhood and my car is usually a short walk to a public parking space).I live in Chicago where you get lots of variable weather and this jacket is perfect for the in-between seasons when the temp varies from 40 to 60 degrees."
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket,Awesome.  I bought this in 2 colors and sizes.,5.0,"I'm 6'1 175lbs and I bought a large in yellow.  It fit slim but perfect.  I bought an extra large in navy & blue.  It fit larger all around and gave room for a fitted jacket and sweater underneath.  The seams, cut and finish are excellent.  The zipper is protected with a velcro system.  The hood is perfect.  I haven't tried it in heavy rain yet.  This is a thin waterproof shell that won't keep you warm in deep cold without layers. Overall awesome."
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket,Dry in pouring rain.,4.0,"I like this jacket. I just wore it for the first time in a driving windy rainstorm, and remained dry underneath. It's lightweight and well ventilated with an adjustable hood. It has two outer zipper pockets but no inner pockets. An inner breast pocket for a phone would be very nice, and for $40 you would think it would have one or two. I'm 6'2"", 190 and ordered a large, which was Way too tight. The XL is perfect"
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket,not as described,1.0,"advertised as ""waterproof""  ...Is NOT the tag  states otherwise!"
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket,"It looked great, and fit well",3.0,"Not sure if I got a dud, but mine leaked water through the seam where the hood attaches.  Probably wouldn't have been a problem for light rain, but would've been a problem for heavy rain.  It looked great, and fit well.  I would've kept it if it wasn't for this problem."
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket,"With Exception of a ""Loophole,"" It's Perfect",5.0,"Good quality, good fit and overall good product!Now that said- I want to add a mini rant/observation about jackets in general-How many jackets do you own, that came with that little loop sewn into the back inside collar,  so that you could hang that jacket from the loop, on a hook?Now how many of those jackets that you own, (that have that loop) and the loop is now broken, making the former loop, unusable?For me, almost all my jackets that came with that loop, are broken, including this one. It took only the second use of this jacket, for an unintentional slight tug on the jacket (while hanging on a hook by that loop), for the loop to break... which makes me think, that it's a (literal) jacket maker ""loophole"" conspiracy, that all these loops are meant to easily break and frustrate the jacket owner. I suppose a broken loop is better than a torn jacket, but whatever... Rant over ;-)"

Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket, Charcoal, XL

   because the product description CLEARLY states that the jacket is ""WATERPROOF"".When the jacket arrived, I opened the package and found a tag CLEARLY stating that the jacket is ""WATER RESISTANT"".I ordered an XL which fit fine, but I have no idea if the jacket is warm because I didn't bother to try it out before I sent it back!!!I for one don't like to be lied to!!Also, If color matters to you Tommy Hilfiger's idea of ""Charcoal"" is far different than mine!! Charcoal is dark gray/black, the jacket I was sent was blue.This is a clear case of Product Misrepresentation!"
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket,NOT WATERPROOF AS STATED!,1.0,"Item description clearly states WATERPROOF, tag on delivered item clearly states WATER RESISTANT ........... those are two very different things!"
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket,Not waterproof,2.0,"Pretty nice, thin jacket. The hood is HUGE. Like, I can't see when it's up. I need to wear a hat under the hood when it's raining which is annoying. And, of course, it's not waterproof like the description says it is. It clear says it's ""water resistant"" on the tag. Big difference. Of course, I know there are really no jackets this lightweight that are truly waterproof, but overall disappointing. For a water resistant jacket, it's pretty nice, if you don't have to put the hood up. I get hot easily, and this one seems fairly cool."
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket,Nice jacket for price,4.0,"I am a tall female so i usually wear mens jackets for the arm length and upper body length. I ordered a medium and im glad I did. (5""9 weigh 140) The fit was roomy not tight but the jacket is thin.  I didnt want a puffer or bulky coat. This jacket is good for layering underneath. The length comes to middle of butt."
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket,Very nice for the money,4.0,"I'm 5'7"", 155 pounds and a small fit perfectly. It's comfortable and perfect over a sweater/t-shirt combo. Nice hood with a drawstring and includes a drawstring around the waist to keep wind from blowing under.My only problem is that the zipper jams a lot. However, I had a nearly identical Columbia jacket that I lost and this one is nicer even with the troublesome zipper. Nicer lining, better fit, and a little better looking IMO.It's not waterproof - duh, you don't get waterproof for $50 - but it will keep you reasonably dry if you're briefly in light rain as I often am (I live in a city neighborhood and my car is usually a short walk to a public parking space).I live in Chicago where you get lots of variable weather and this jacket is perfect for the in-between seasons when the temp varies from 40 to 60 degrees."
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket,Awesome.  I bought this in 2 colors and sizes.,5.0,"I'm 6'1 175lbs and I bought a large in yellow.  It fit slim but perfect.  I bought an extra large in navy & blue.  It fit larger all around and gave room for a fitted jacket and sweater underneath.  The seams, cut and finish are excellent.  The zipper is protected with a velcro system.  The hood is perfect.  I haven't tried it in heavy rain yet.  This is a thin waterproof shell that won't keep you warm in deep cold without layers.

Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket,Dry in pouring rain.,4.0,"I like this jacket. I just wore it for the first time in a driving windy rainstorm, and remained dry underneath.

The zipper is protected with a velcro system.  The hood is perfect.  I haven't tried it in heavy rain yet.  This is a thin waterproof shell that won't keep you warm in deep cold without layers. Overall awesome."
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket,Dry in pouring rain.,4.0,"I like this jacket. I just wore it for the first time in a driving windy rainstorm, and remained dry underneath. It's lightweight and well ventilated with an adjustable hood. It has two outer zipper pockets but no inner pockets. An inner breast pocket for a phone would be very nice, and for $40 you would think it would have one or two. I'm 6'2"", 190 and ordered a large, which was Way too tight. The XL is perfect"
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket,not as described,1.0,"advertised as ""waterproof""  ...Is NOT the tag  states otherwise!"
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket,"It looked great, and fit well",3.0,"Not sure if I got a dud, but mine leaked water through the seam where the hood attaches.  Probably wouldn't have been a problem for light rain, but would've been a problem for heavy rain.  It looked great, and fit well.  I would've kept it if it wasn't for this problem."
Tommy Hilfiger Men's Waterproof Breathable Hooded Jacket,"With Exception of a ""Loophole,"" It's Perfect",5.0,"Good quality, good fit and overall good product!Now that said- I want to add a mini rant/observation about jackets in general-How many jackets do you own, that came with that little loop sewn into the back inside collar,  so that you could hang that jacket from the loop, on a hook?Now how many of those jackets that you own, (that have that loop) and the loop is now broken, making the former loop, unusable?For me, almost all my jackets that came with that loop, are broken, including this one. It took only the second use of this jacket, for an unintentional slight tug on the jacket (while hanging on a hook by that loop), for the loop to break... which makes me think, that it's a (literal) jacket maker ""loophole"" conspiracy, that all these loops are meant to easily break and frustrate the jacket owner. I suppose a broken loop is better than a torn jacket, but whatever... Rant over ;-)"
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,"Beautiful, thick, well made, great looking jackets..... but arms are way too narrow",4.0,"Here is the real deal with these jackets... From the good, the bad, to the unfortunate.The Good:The prices on Amazon for these jackets are amazing! The jackets are beautiful, well made, thick with sherpa insulation in the torso and plenty of thick insulation in the arms. The denim washes are consistent throughout the garment and look just like the pictures you see pictured online. In my opinion they are simply strong, well made, beautiful jackets. I love them.but....The Bad:The arms in these jackets run narrow, so if you have any sort of upper arm musculature they will be tight, too tight. This will force you into buying the next larger size jacket in order to increase the arm width (which is still snug but doable). The problem now is the jacket will be longer and wider in the torso... That's an issue because the jacket simply looks too big, wide, and long!The Solutions:1) Some folks have tried getting around this by buying the larger size, washing and drying in order to shrink the garment (because shrinkage mostly occurs in the length of the arms and torso and a little bit in width), then wear the garment to try and stretch out the denim. Remember it is denim so it will stretch quite a bit just like your jeans do... BUT there is no guarantee it will shrink enough in all the areas you want for a perfect fit..2) You pay a tailor to increase the upper arm width by sewing in extra denim fabric or stretch fabric...3) You go to Sears or a local Levis location and try on a dozen jackets to find one that fits you just right...4) You buy a vintage 70's, 80's, 90's pre-owned jacket which were cut larger in the arms back then...Point is this: If you are tall and slender with slender arms the jacket will fit. If you are overweight with thin arms the jacket will fit. If you are built with a keg like torso and stick like arms the jacket will fit.The Unfortunate:However... If you are athletic in any way and have average muscle size, medium muscles, larger muscles, or huge muscles the jacket will not fit your arms... period. The jacket will fit in the shoulders and the torso but not the arms. Can you see the recurring theme here?My solution:I tried both the large and the XL and neither fit my arms properly and were way too wide and long in the body. (Therefore I had to return them to Amazon.) Unfortunately I ended up going to a local retailer (paid way more than if purchased through amazon) tried on 20+ jackets, got lucky, and found something I could break in. I also bought another one (by going the vintage route via ebay) which worked out even better because they were made bigger and different back then.Great jackets but terrible fit. All Levis needs to do is increase the upper arm width by 1.5 inches in order to compensate for the extra insulation put there. This is why the Sherpa jackets have this sizing problem because the manufacturers are using the pre-existing un-insulated denim jackets as the base model, filling it up with sherpa and arm insulation and....boom....poor fitting jackets."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Great jacket!,5.0,"Ok, so, for starters I'm a woman, ha. I really loved the style of this jacket but I was worried, based on reviews, that the women's version would be a bit too cropped on me, so I thought I would try the men's. I'm tall and thin - 5'9"" 143 pounds. I bought this jacket in a size Medium, which is the size that I would normally fit into in men's clothing. It fits perfectly on me, and falls right where I wanted it to - right about hip length. The sleeves go a little past my wrists, which kinda surprised me because I do have pretty long arms. However, I prefer my sleeves to be a bit longer so I'm happy about that. The upper arms are pretty roomy, though, because obviously this is made for men and I have virtually no upper body musculature, lol. I can see how these jackets might run a tad small for men because even with the little bit of extra room for me to move around in, it's still a very fitted jacket overall.I can layer thicker long sleeve shirts and thin sweatshirts underneath of it and still am able to button it up. But nothing too bulky. This jacket is surprisingly warm, though, thanks to the sherpa lining. The sleeves have a quilted polyamide/polyester lining - certainly not as warm as the body but still pretty decent. I really like the hidden pocket on the inside of the jacket - it's a good size for your phone or wallet. My only complaints, I guess, would be that I wish the front pockets had a sherpa lining as well to keep your hands warm. I'm also not a fan of the snap closure buttons. The color that I ordered - Mustard Blue Denim - is really nice in person and pairs well with darker jeans.Anyway, I think this is a great, warm, handsome jacket that would be well worth buying if you can figure out which size works best for you. I would suggest going with the size you would normally wear in jackets, and if that doesn't fit then try going up a size. Also, consult the size chart on the levi's website as it does seem to be fairly accurate, at least for the size that I bought."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Great gift!,5.0,"I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and I figured I might as well model it for the review lol. He’s 5’8”, about 180 pounds, and his pant size is a 36X32. I got him the extra large after reading reviews that the arms were small and I’m glad I did because he’s a bit muscular in the arms. This is the same jacket that they’re trying to hock for 3 times the price at urban outfitters. For reference I’m 5’7” and 130 pounds and the color of the jacket bought is mustard blue. I might have to get a matching one for me the quality is super nice and I like the fit better than women’s."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,a plus size woman buying this coat.,5.0,"I am a curvy plus size woman.270lbs, 40F bra size, 5'6-ish in height..usually 2xl-3xl in woman plus/L-xl in menI enjoy being frugal but a fashionable individualI wear women and men clothing items/accessories and customize it to my own if need beSo when I saw this jacket awhile back I knew I had to have it but refused to pay Levis' price of a $125Luckily I spotted this jacket on the great Amazon in the women's version read a lot of the reviews on here and levi's website even the sizing chart and I realized I would be playing myself if I brought in the woman's or woman's plus so I decided to try it in the men's and saw that everyone from men and women saying this jacket runs small and they were not lying...I previously brought it in a xxl because I rather something be a little too big then too small and the arms felt good the jacket wasn't too long but at the same time I am very hippy with a big butt so nothing really goes pass my booty anyways hahahaIt felt ok around the midsection but could of been a little roomier but would not close on my chest so I returned it back and wanted to completely give up on the jacket because I was so excited to get it and greatly disappointed even thou I was buying bigger sizes in men that I knew that was too big for me but was completely confused why this jacket didn't fit right at all but something kept telling me to go for the 3xl which is the last size for this jacket and if it didn't fit I was over it! I exchanged for the 3xl and actually was able to get the color I wanted and it fitted perfectly but it's still a fitted jacket and it's suppose to fit tapered to the body with a little wiggle room.So with that being said I am letting you know right now that this style of jacket runs SMALL I say get a size up or two especially if you're on the plushy side if you're skinny or average you MIGHT be able to get away with your size but I recommend sizing up. I am from NY and our winters are pretty cold and with a nice thick hoodie/sweater and this jacket I was nice and warm but that's me...everybody is different.This jacket is super nice in person, I got the Turkish Brown and have received a lot of compliments so far even thou it's a men's jacket! So ladies don't hesitant to buy this item because it's a men's jacket as long as you know how to slay it and make it your own you can wear anything!xoxo"
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,"Great fit - Surprisingly heavy, well made and really good for price",5.0,"I'm 6'1 165 lbs and this jacket (MEDIUM) is absolutely perfect. I have long arms and long legs, see how it fits in opicture. In terms of length this is what this style of Jacket is supposed to be. Very happy with the purchase. It was heavier than expected, which is honestly a great thing. Should work for weathers 50-55 degrees+. Anything colder than that you should get a heavier jacket. Also very comfy and soft on the inside."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,"Smaller than expected, still a good jacket",4.0,"I ordered this jacket in a medium thinking that it would be slightly oversized on me, since I am female and most men's clothing tends to run larger on me. Turns out that this jacket delivers a more fitted look, even at this size which really surprised me. The arms are a little stiff, there is just enough wiggle-room but I definitely need to wear this jacket in for a while for it to be comfier. When I button it up, the fit is more snug than I usually like but it's workable, it's just a bit weird because for me there is more room in the waist area but it's tighter around the bottom. This is only a first-impression review, but I do think this seems like a really good quality jacket. I love how the buttons are a snap closure, and I love the color as well, I got the mustard blue shade. I will say though, if you're a guy looking to order this jacket I would suggest ordering several sizes larger than what you are used to, if you don't want it to be too snug. Otherwise maybe just skip this one altogether. I was thinking about returning mine, but I've decided to keep it in hopes that the denim will stretch out a little more the longer I wear it. For reference I'm 5'5"" tall, about 130lbs and the length of this jacket goes down just below my hips, so for a taller person it would probably hit right at the hips or even above that. Overall if you're on the fence about this one like I was, I'd say give it a shot."

Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Love the jacket but extremely dissatisfied,1.0,"I love this sherpa jacket as far as fit, and style. Everything is perfect except 1 major flaw. I ordered the black sherpa and the jacket came packaged with an intense smell of dye. It reminds me of these cheap jean pants from anchorblue I wore when I was young that had the same bad smell to them . So I know the jacket shouldn't smell this way normally because the black sherpas in store don't smell like this, plus my girlfriend ordered the same exact version directly from the Levi's store and no scent on that one as well. I've tried washing them once and the smell improved just a tiny bit but still very strong and noticeable. I barely wear them now just hanging out on a chair near a window being aired out but no improvement. I don't really want to or should I even have to continously wash/treat the jacket to eliminate the smell at the cost of ruining it. I'm extremely dissatisfied with this purchase. Beware, if you want a dark colored sherpa just go to the levi store directly. I wanted to purchase another jacket in a different color until this happened. I will not be dealing with the amazon version ever again."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Misled and upset,1.0,"I am highly upset. I’ve been to multiple Levi stores and department stores for this specific jacket. However, at the stores the color is not mustard denim that is a lighter blue but a darker denim. On the amazon description and even the reviewers that post pictures, it also indicated the light blue mustard denim that I needed. I scanned every review and q+a to see if there was an updated inventory that changed the light blue mustard into a darker denim. There was not. Hence, I was misled to buy this jacket that was inaccurately advertised. I spent money, waited for delivery, just to be disappointed, and now it is of great inconvenience because I have to somehow come up with a last minute present or give the present as it is to my son who may be very unsatisfied. I am a big Levi supporter but this is a great disappointment ."

I'm tall and thin - 5'9"" 143 pounds. I bought this jacket in a size Medium, which is the size that I would normally fit into in men's clothing. It fits perfectly on me, and falls right where I wanted it to - right about hip length. The sleeves go a little past my wrists, which kinda surprised me because I do have pretty long arms. However, I prefer my sleeves to be a bit longer so I'm happy about that. The upper arms are pretty roomy, though, because obviously this is made for men and I have virtually no upper body musculature, lol. I can see how these jackets might run a tad small for men because even with the little bit of extra room for me to move around in, it's still a very fitted jacket overall.I can layer thicker long sleeve shirts and thin sweatshirts underneath of it and still am able to button it up. But nothing too bulky. This jacket is surprisingly warm, though, thanks to the sherpa lining. The sleeves have a quilted polyamide/polyester lining - certainly not as warm as the body but still pretty decent. I really like the hidden pocket on the inside of the jacket - it's a good size for your phone or wallet. My only complaints, I guess, would be that I wish the front pockets had a sherpa lining as well to keep your hands warm. I'm also not a fan of the snap closure buttons. The color that I ordered - Mustard Blue Denim - is really nice in person and pairs well with darker jeans.Anyway, I think this is a great, warm, handsome jacket that would be well worth buying if you can figure out which size works best for you. I would suggest going with the size you would normally wear in jackets, and if that doesn't fit then try going up a size. Also, consult the size chart on the levi's website as it does seem to be fairly accurate, at least for the size that I bought."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Great gift!,5.0,"I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and I figured I might as well model it for the review lol. He’s 5’8”, about 180 pounds, and his pant size is a 36X32. I got him the extra large after reading reviews that the arms were small and I’m glad I did because he’s a bit muscular in the arms. This is the same jacket that they’re trying to hock for 3 times the price at urban outfitters. For reference I’m 5’7” and 130 pounds and the color of the jacket bought is mustard blue. I might have to get a matching one for me the quality is super nice and I like the fit better than women’s."

Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,"Great fit - Surprisingly heavy, well made and really good for price",5.0,"I'm 6'1 165 lbs and this jacket (MEDIUM) is absolutely perfect. I have long arms and long legs, see how it fits in opicture. In terms of length this is what this style of Jacket is supposed to be. Very happy with the purchase. It was heavier than expected, which is honestly a great thing. Should work for weathers 50-55 degrees+. Anything colder than that you should get a heavier jacket. Also very comfy and soft on the inside."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,"Smaller than expected, still a good jacket",4.0,"I ordered this jacket in a medium thinking that it would be slightly oversized on me, since I am female and most men's clothing tends to run larger on me. Turns out that this jacket delivers a more fitted look, even at this size which really surprised me. The arms are a little stiff, there is just enough wiggle-room but I definitely need to wear this jacket in for a while for it to be comfier. When I button it up, the fit is more snug than I usually like but it's workable, it's just a bit weird because for me there is more room in the waist area but it's tighter around the bottom. This is only a first-impression review, but I do think this seems like a really good quality jacket. I love how the buttons are a snap closure, and I love the color as well, I got the mustard blue shade. I will say though, if you're a guy looking to order this jacket I would suggest ordering several sizes larger than what you are used to, if you don't want it to be too snug. Otherwise maybe just skip this one altogether. I was thinking about returning mine, but I've decided to keep it in hopes that the denim will stretch out a little more the longer I wear it. For reference I'm 5'5"" tall, about 130lbs and the length of this jacket goes down just below my hips, so for a taller person it would probably hit right at the hips or even above that. Overall if you're on the fence about this one like I was, I'd say give it a shot."

I'll wear it in south central Alaska Sept & Oct. Nov - Feb it will not be warm enough. A good looking jacket for Spring and Fall."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Love the jacket but extremely dissatisfied,1.0,"I love this sherpa jacket as far as fit, and style. Everything is perfect except 1 major flaw. I ordered the black sherpa and the jacket came packaged with an intense smell of dye. It reminds me of these cheap jean pants from anchorblue I wore when I was young that had the same bad smell to them . So I know the jacket shouldn't smell this way normally because the black sherpas in store don't smell like this, plus my girlfriend ordered the same exact version directly from the Levi's store and no scent on that one as well. I've tried washing them once and the smell improved just a tiny bit but still very strong and noticeable. I barely wear them now just hanging out on a chair near a window being aired out but no improvement. I don't really want to or should I even have to continously wash/treat the jacket to eliminate the smell at the cost of ruining it. I'm extremely dissatisfied with this purchase. Beware, if you want a dark colored sherpa just go to the levi store directly. I wanted to purchase another jacket in a different color until this happened. I will not be dealing with the amazon version ever again."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Misled and upset,1.0,"I am highly upset. I’ve been to multiple Levi stores and department stores for this specific jacket. However, at the stores the color is not mustard denim that is a lighter blue but a darker denim. On the amazon description and even the reviewers that post pictures, it also indicated the light blue mustard denim that I needed. I scanned every review and q+a to see if there was an updated inventory that changed the light blue mustard into a darker denim. There was not. Hence, I was misled to buy this jacket that was inaccurately advertised. I spent money, waited for delivery, just to be disappointed, and now it is of great inconvenience because I have to somehow come up with a last minute present or give the present as it is to my son who may be very unsatisfied. I am a big Levi supporter but this is a great disappointment ."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,The jacket fits fine. I was going to buy a size L,5.0,"So I'm a plus size woman. After reading the reviews on the female version of the jacket, i knew that i was not going to fit in one. One of the reviews suggested to buy a male version of the jacket. Which is what I did. The jacket fits fine. I was going to buy a size L, but based on the review i went up a size. The jacket feels just right. The only downside I have is the broad shoulders. The jacket does not curve on my shoulders, its more like a squared look."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,"Beautiful, thick, well made, great looking jackets..... but arms are way too narrow",4.0,"Here is the real deal with these jackets... From the good, the bad, to the unfortunate.The Good:The prices on Amazon for these jackets are amazing! The jackets are beautiful, well made, thick with sherpa insulation in the torso and plenty of thick insulation in the arms. The denim washes are consistent throughout the garment and look just like the pictures you see pictured online. In my opinion they are simply strong, well made, beautiful jackets. I love them.but....The Bad:The arms in these jackets run narrow, so if you have any sort of upper arm musculature they will be tight, too tight. This will force you into buying the next larger size jacket in order to increase the arm width (which is still snug but doable). The problem now is the jacket will be longer and wider in the torso... That's an issue because the jacket simply looks too big, wide, and long!The Solutions:1) Some folks have tried getting around this by buying the larger size, washing and drying in order to shrink the garment (because shrinkage mostly occurs in the length of the arms and torso and a little bit in width), then wear the garment to try and stretch out the denim. Remember it is denim so it will stretch quite a bit just like your jeans do... BUT there is no guarantee it will shrink enough in all the areas you want for a perfect fit..2) You pay a tailor to increase the upper arm width by sewing in extra denim fabric or stretch fabric...3) You go to Sears or a local Levis location and try on a dozen jackets to find one that fits you just right...4) You buy a vintage 70's, 80's, 90's pre-owned jacket which were cut larger in the arms back then...Point is this: If you are tall and slender with slender arms the jacket will fit. If you are overweight with thin arms the jacket will fit. If you are built with a keg like torso and stick like arms the jacket will fit.The Unfortunate:However... If you are athletic in any way and have average muscle size, medium muscles, larger muscles, or huge muscles the jacket will not fit your arms... period. The jacket will fit in the shoulders and the torso but not the arms. Can you see the recurring theme here?My solution:I tried both the large and the XL and neither fit my arms properly and were way too wide and long in the body. (Therefore I had to return them to Amazon.) Unfortunately I ended up going to a local retailer (paid way more than if purchased through amazon) tried on 20+ jackets, got lucky, and found something I could break in. I also bought another one (by going the vintage route via ebay) which worked out even better because they were made bigger and different back then.Great jackets but terrible fit. All Levis needs to do is increase the upper arm width by 1.5 inches in order to compensate for the extra insulation put there. This is why the Sherpa jackets have this sizing problem because the manufacturers are using the pre-existing un-insulated denim jackets as the base model, filling it up with sherpa and arm insulation and....boom....poor fitting jackets."

Turns out that this jacket delivers a more fitted look, even at this size which really surprised me. The arms are a little stiff, there is just enough wiggle-room but I definitely need to wear this jacket in for a while for it to be comfier. When I button it up, the fit is more snug than I usually like but it's workable, it's just a bit weird because for me there is more room in the waist area but it's tighter around the bottom. This is only a first-impression review, but I do think this seems like a really good quality jacket. I love how the buttons are a snap closure, and I love the color as well, I got the mustard blue shade. I will say though, if you're a guy looking to order this jacket I would suggest ordering several sizes larger than what you are used to, if you don't want it to be too snug. Otherwise maybe just skip this one altogether. I was thinking about returning mine, but I've decided to keep it in hopes that the denim will stretch out a little more the longer I wear it. For reference I'm 5'5"" tall, about 130lbs and the length of this jacket goes down just below my hips, so for a taller person it would probably hit right at the hips or even above that. Overall if you're on the fence about this one like I was, I'd say give it a shot."

Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Love the jacket but extremely dissatisfied,1.0,"I love this sherpa jacket as far as fit, and style. Everything is perfect except 1 major flaw. I ordered the black sherpa and the jacket came packaged with an intense smell of dye. It reminds me of these cheap jean pants from anchorblue I wore when I was young that had the same bad smell to them . So I know the jacket shouldn't smell this way normally because the black sherpas in store don't smell like this, plus my girlfriend ordered the same exact version directly from the Levi's store and no scent on that one as well. I've tried washing them once and the smell improved just a tiny bit but still very strong and noticeable. I barely wear them now just hanging out on a chair near a window being aired out but no improvement. I don't really want to or should I even have to continously wash/treat the jacket to eliminate the smell at the cost of ruining it. I'm extremely dissatisfied with this purchase. Beware, if you want a dark colored sherpa just go to the levi store directly. I wanted to purchase another jacket in a different color until this happened. I will not be dealing with the amazon version ever again."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Misled and upset,1.0,"I am highly upset. I’ve been to multiple Levi stores and department stores for this specific jacket.

Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,"Beautiful, thick, well made, great looking jackets..... but arms are way too narrow",4.0,"Here is the real deal with these jackets... From the good, the bad, to the unfortunate.The Good:The prices on Amazon for these jackets are amazing! The jackets are beautiful, well made, thick with sherpa insulation in the torso and plenty of thick insulation in the arms. The denim washes are consistent throughout the garment and look just like the pictures you see pictured online. In my opinion they are simply strong, well made, beautiful jackets. I love them.but....The Bad:The arms in these jackets run narrow, so if you have any sort of upper arm musculature they will be tight, too tight. This will force you into buying the next larger size jacket in order to increase the arm width (which is still snug but doable). The problem now is the jacket will be longer and wider in the torso... That's an issue because the jacket simply looks too big, wide, and long!The Solutions:1) Some folks have tried getting around this by buying the larger size, washing and drying in order to shrink the garment (because shrinkage mostly occurs in the length of the arms and torso and a little bit in width), then wear the garment to try and stretch out the denim. Remember it is denim so it will stretch quite a bit just like your jeans do... BUT there is no guarantee it will shrink enough in all the areas you want for a perfect fit..2) You pay a tailor to increase the upper arm width by sewing in extra denim fabric or stretch fabric...3) You go to Sears or a local Levis location and try on a dozen jackets to find one that fits you just right...4) You buy a vintage 70's, 80's, 90's pre-owned jacket which were cut larger in the arms back then...Point is this: If you are tall and slender with slender arms the jacket will fit. If you are overweight with thin arms the jacket will fit. If you are built with a keg like torso and stick like arms the jacket will fit.The Unfortunate:However... If you are athletic in any way and have average muscle size, medium muscles, larger muscles, or huge muscles the jacket will not fit your arms... period. The jacket will fit in the shoulders and the torso but not the arms. Can you see the recurring theme here?My solution:I tried both the large and the XL and neither fit my arms properly and were way too wide and long in the body. (Therefore I had to return them to Amazon.) Unfortunately I ended up going to a local retailer (paid way more than if purchased through amazon) tried on 20+ jackets, got lucky, and found something I could break in. I also bought another one (by going the vintage route via ebay) which worked out even better because they were made bigger and different back then.Great jackets but terrible fit. All Levis needs to do is increase the upper arm width by 1.5 inches in order to compensate for the extra insulation put there. This is why the Sherpa jackets have this sizing problem because the manufacturers are using the pre-existing un-insulated denim jackets as the base model, filling it up with sherpa and arm insulation and....boom....poor fitting jackets."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Great jacket!,5.0,"Ok, so, for starters I'm a woman, ha. I really loved the style of this jacket but I was worried, based on reviews, that the women's version would be a bit too cropped on me, so I thought I would try the men's. I'm tall and thin - 5'9"" 143 pounds. I bought this jacket in a size Medium, which is the size that I would normally fit into in men's clothing. It fits perfectly on me, and falls right where I wanted it to - right about hip length. The sleeves go a little past my wrists, which kinda surprised me because I do have pretty long arms. However, I prefer my sleeves to be a bit longer so I'm happy about that. The upper arms are pretty roomy, though, because obviously this is made for men and I have virtually no upper body musculature, lol. I can see how these jackets might run a tad small for men because even with the little bit of extra room for me to move around in, it's still a very fitted jacket overall.I can layer thicker long sleeve shirts and thin sweatshirts underneath of it and still am able to button it up. But nothing too bulky. This jacket is surprisingly warm, though, thanks to the sherpa lining. The sleeves have a quilted polyamide/polyester lining - certainly not as warm as the body but still pretty decent. I really like the hidden pocket on the inside of the jacket - it's a good size for your phone or wallet. My only complaints, I guess, would be that I wish the front pockets had a sherpa lining as well to keep your hands warm. I'm also not a fan of the snap closure buttons. The color that I ordered - Mustard Blue Denim - is really nice in person and pairs well with darker jeans.Anyway, I think this is a great, warm, handsome jacket that would be well worth buying if you can figure out which size works best for you. I would suggest going with the size you would normally wear in jackets, and if that doesn't fit then try going up a size. Also, consult the size chart on the levi's website as it does seem to be fairly accurate, at least for the size that I bought."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Great gift!,5.0,"I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and I figured I might as well model it for the review lol. He’s 5’8”, about 180 pounds, and his pant size is a 36X32. I got him the extra large after reading reviews that the arms were small and I’m glad I did because he’s a bit muscular in the arms. This is the same jacket that they’re trying to hock for 3 times the price at urban outfitters. For reference I’m 5’7” and 130 pounds and the color of the jacket bought is mustard blue. I might have to get a matching one for me the quality is super nice and I like the fit better than women’s."

I exchanged for the 3xl and actually was able to get the color I wanted and it fitted perfectly but it's still a fitted jacket and it's suppose to fit tapered to the body with a little wiggle room.So with that being said I am letting you know right now that this style of jacket runs SMALL I say get a size up or two especially if you're on the plushy side if you're skinny or average you MIGHT be able to get away with your size but I recommend sizing up. I am from NY and our winters are pretty cold and with a nice thick hoodie/sweater and this jacket I was nice and warm but that's me...everybody is different.This jacket is super nice in person, I got the Turkish Brown and have received a lot of compliments so far even thou it's a men's jacket!

BUT there is no guarantee it will shrink enough in all the areas you want for a perfect fit..2) You pay a tailor to increase the upper arm width by sewing in extra denim fabric or stretch fabric...3) You go to Sears or a local Levis location and try on a dozen jackets to find one that fits you just right...4) You buy a vintage 70's, 80's, 90's pre-owned jacket which were cut larger in the arms back then...Point is this: If you are tall and slender with slender arms the jacket will fit. If you are overweight with thin arms the jacket will fit. If you are built with a keg like torso and stick like arms the jacket will fit.The Unfortunate:However... If you are athletic in any way and have average muscle size, medium muscles, larger muscles, or huge muscles the jacket will not fit your arms... period. The jacket will fit in the shoulders and the torso but not the arms. Can you see the recurring theme here?My solution:I tried both the large and the XL and neither fit my arms properly and were way too wide and long in the body. (Therefore I had to return them to Amazon.) Unfortunately I ended up going to a local retailer (paid way more than if purchased through amazon) tried on 20+ jackets, got lucky, and found something I could break in. I also bought another one (by going the vintage route via ebay) which worked out even better because they were made bigger and different back then.Great jackets but terrible fit. All Levis needs to do is increase the upper arm width by 1.5 inches in order to compensate for the extra insulation put there. This is why the Sherpa jackets have this sizing problem because the manufacturers are using the pre-existing un-insulated denim jackets as the base model, filling it up with sherpa and arm insulation and....boom....poor fitting jackets."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Great jacket!,5.0,"Ok, so, for starters I'm a woman, ha. I really loved the style of this jacket but I was worried, based on reviews, that the women's version would be a bit too cropped on me, so I thought I would try the men's. I'm tall and thin - 5'9"" 143 pounds. I bought this jacket in a size Medium, which is the size that I would normally fit into in men's clothing. It fits perfectly on me, and falls right where I wanted it to - right about hip length. The sleeves go a little past my wrists, which kinda surprised me because I do have pretty long arms. However, I prefer my sleeves to be a bit longer so I'm happy about that. The upper arms are pretty roomy, though, because obviously this is made for men and I have virtually no upper body musculature, lol. I can see how these jackets might run a tad small for men because even with the little bit of extra room for me to move around in, it's still a very fitted jacket overall.I can layer thicker long sleeve shirts and thin sweatshirts underneath of it and still am able to button it up. But nothing too bulky. This jacket is surprisingly warm, though, thanks to the sherpa lining. The sleeves have a quilted polyamide/polyester lining - certainly not as warm as the body but still pretty decent. I really like the hidden pocket on the inside of the jacket - it's a good size for your phone or wallet. My only complaints, I guess, would be that I wish the front pockets had a sherpa lining as well to keep your hands warm. I'm also not a fan of the snap closure buttons. The color that I ordered - Mustard Blue Denim - is really nice in person and pairs well with darker jeans.Anyway, I think this is a great, warm, handsome jacket that would be well worth buying if you can figure out which size works best for you. I would suggest going with the size you would normally wear in jackets, and if that doesn't fit then try going up a size. Also, consult the size chart on the levi's website as it does seem to be fairly accurate, at least for the size that I bought."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Great gift!,5.0,"I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and I figured I might as well model it for the review lol. He’s 5’8”, about 180 pounds, and his pant size is a 36X32. I got him the extra large after reading reviews that the arms were small and I’m glad I did because he’s a bit muscular in the arms. This is the same jacket that they’re trying to hock for 3 times the price at urban outfitters. For reference I’m 5’7” and 130 pounds and the color of the jacket bought is mustard blue. I might have to get a matching one for me the quality is super nice and I like the fit better than women’s."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,a plus size woman buying this coat.,5.0,"I am a curvy plus size woman.270lbs, 40F bra size, 5'6-ish in height..usually 2xl-3xl in woman plus/L-xl in menI enjoy being frugal but a fashionable individualI wear women and men clothing items/accessories and customize it to my own if need beSo when I saw this jacket awhile back I knew I had to have it but refused to pay Levis' price of a $125Luckily I spotted this jacket on the great Amazon in the women's version read a lot of the reviews on here and levi's website even the sizing chart and I realized I would be playing myself if I brought in the woman's or woman's plus so I decided to try it in the men's and saw that everyone from men and women saying this jacket runs small and they were not lying...I previously brought it in a xxl because I rather something be a little too big then too small and the arms felt good the jacket wasn't too long but at the same time I am very hippy with a big butt so nothing really goes pass my booty anyways hahahaIt felt ok around the midsection but could of been a little roomier but would not close on my chest so I returned it back and wanted to completely give up on the jacket because I was so excited to get it and greatly disappointed even thou I was buying bigger sizes in men that I knew that was too big for me but was completely confused why this jacket didn't fit right at all but something kept telling me to go for the 3xl which is the last size for this jacket and if it didn't fit I was over it! I exchanged for the 3xl and actually was able to get the color I wanted and it fitted perfectly but it's still a fitted jacket and it's suppose to fit tapered to the body with a little wiggle room.So with that being said I am letting you know right now that this style of jacket runs SMALL I say get a size up or two especially if you're on the plushy side if you're skinny or average you MIGHT be able to get away with your size but I recommend sizing up. I am from NY and our winters are pretty cold and with a nice thick hoodie/sweater and this jacket I was nice and warm but that's me...everybody is different.This jacket is super nice in person, I got the Turkish Brown and have received a lot of compliments so far even thou it's a men's jacket! So ladies don't hesitant to buy this item because it's a men's jacket as long as you know how to slay it and make it your own you can wear anything!xoxo"
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,"Great fit - Surprisingly heavy, well made and really good for price",5.0,"I'm 6'1 165 lbs and this jacket (MEDIUM) is absolutely perfect. I have long arms and long legs, see how it fits in opicture. In terms of length this is what this style of Jacket is supposed to be. Very happy with the purchase. It was heavier than expected, which is honestly a great thing. Should work for weathers 50-55 degrees+. Anything colder than that you should get a heavier jacket. Also very comfy and soft on the inside."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,"Smaller than expected, still a good jacket",4.0,"I ordered this jacket in a medium thinking that it would be slightly oversized on me, since I am female and most men's clothing tends to run larger on me. Turns out that this jacket delivers a more fitted look, even at this size which really surprised me. The arms are a little stiff, there is just enough wiggle-room but I definitely need to wear this jacket in for a while for it to be comfier. When I button it up, the fit is more snug than I usually like but it's workable, it's just a bit weird because for me there is more room in the waist area but it's tighter around the bottom. This is only a first-impression review, but I do think this seems like a really good quality jacket. I love how the buttons are a snap closure, and I love the color as well, I got the mustard blue shade. I will say though, if you're a guy looking to order this jacket I would suggest ordering several sizes larger than what you are used to, if you don't want it to be too snug. Otherwise maybe just skip this one altogether. I was thinking about returning mine, but I've decided to keep it in hopes that the denim will stretch out a little more the longer I wear it. For reference I'm 5'5"" tall, about 130lbs and the length of this jacket goes down just below my hips, so for a taller person it would probably hit right at the hips or even above that. Overall if you're on the fence about this one like I was, I'd say give it a shot."

This jacket fits perfectly.If I were any heavier than about 185lb I'd say going a size up would be the right call.This jacket looks great and feels great. I'll wear it in south central Alaska Sept & Oct. Nov - Feb it will not be warm enough. A good looking jacket for Spring and Fall."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Love the jacket but extremely dissatisfied,1.0,"I love this sherpa jacket as far as fit, and style. Everything is perfect except 1 major flaw. I ordered the black sherpa and the jacket came packaged with an intense smell of dye. It reminds me of these cheap jean pants from anchorblue I wore when I was young that had the same bad smell to them . So I know the jacket shouldn't smell this way normally because the black sherpas in store don't smell like this, plus my girlfriend ordered the same exact version directly from the Levi's store and no scent on that one as well. I've tried washing them once and the smell improved just a tiny bit but still very strong and noticeable. I barely wear them now just hanging out on a chair near a window being aired out but no improvement. I don't really want to or should I even have to continously wash/treat the jacket to eliminate the smell at the cost of ruining it. I'm extremely dissatisfied with this purchase. Beware, if you want a dark colored sherpa just go to the levi store directly. I wanted to purchase another jacket in a different color until this happened. I will not be dealing with the amazon version ever again."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Misled and upset,1.0,"I am highly upset. I’ve been to multiple Levi stores and department stores for this specific jacket. However, at the stores the color is not mustard denim that is a lighter blue but a darker denim. On the amazon description and even the reviewers that post pictures, it also indicated the light blue mustard denim that I needed. I scanned every review and q+a to see if there was an updated inventory that changed the light blue mustard into a darker denim. There was not. Hence, I was misled to buy this jacket that was inaccurately advertised. I spent money, waited for delivery, just to be disappointed, and now it is of great inconvenience because I have to somehow come up with a last minute present or give the present as it is to my son who may be very unsatisfied. I am a big Levi supporter but this is a great disappointment ."

Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,"Beautiful, thick, well made, great looking jackets..... but arms are way too narrow",4.0,"Here is the real deal with these jackets... From the good, the bad, to the unfortunate.The Good:The prices on Amazon for these jackets are amazing!

I exchanged for the 3xl and actually was able to get the color I wanted and it fitted perfectly but it's still a fitted jacket and it's suppose to fit tapered to the body with a little wiggle room.So with that being said I am letting you know right now that this style of jacket runs SMALL I say get a size up or two especially if you're on the plushy side if you're skinny or average you MIGHT be able to get away with your size but I recommend sizing up.

Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,"Great fit - Surprisingly heavy, well made and really good for price",5.0,"I'm 6'1 165 lbs and this jacket (MEDIUM) is absolutely perfect. I have long arms and long legs, see how it fits in opicture. In terms of length this is what this style of Jacket is supposed to be. Very happy with the purchase. It was heavier than expected, which is honestly a great thing. Should work for weathers 50-55 degrees+. Anything colder than that you should get a heavier jacket. Also very comfy and soft on the inside."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,"Smaller than expected, still a good jacket",4.0,"I ordered this jacket in a medium thinking that it would be slightly oversized on me, since I am female and most men's clothing tends to run larger on me. Turns out that this jacket delivers a more fitted look, even at this size which really surprised me. The arms are a little stiff, there is just enough wiggle-room but I definitely need to wear this jacket in for a while for it to be comfier. When I button it up, the fit is more snug than I usually like but it's workable, it's just a bit weird because for me there is more room in the waist area but it's tighter around the bottom. This is only a first-impression review, but I do think this seems like a really good quality jacket. I love how the buttons are a snap closure, and I love the color as well, I got the mustard blue shade. I will say though, if you're a guy looking to order this jacket I would suggest ordering several sizes larger than what you are used to, if you don't want it to be too snug. Otherwise maybe just skip this one altogether. I was thinking about returning mine, but I've decided to keep it in hopes that the denim will stretch out a little more the longer I wear it. For reference I'm 5'5"" tall, about 130lbs and the length of this jacket goes down just below my hips, so for a taller person it would probably hit right at the hips or even above that. Overall if you're on the fence about this one like I was, I'd say give it a shot."

Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Love the jacket but extremely dissatisfied,1.0,"I love this sherpa jacket as far as fit, and style. Everything is perfect except 1 major flaw. I ordered the black sherpa and the jacket came packaged with an intense smell of dye. It reminds me of these cheap jean pants from anchorblue I wore when I was young that had the same bad smell to them . So I know the jacket shouldn't smell this way normally because the black sherpas in store don't smell like this, plus my girlfriend ordered the same exact version directly from the Levi's store and no scent on that one as well. I've tried washing them once and the smell improved just a tiny bit but still very strong and noticeable. I barely wear them now just hanging out on a chair near a window being aired out but no improvement. I don't really want to or should I even have to continously wash/treat the jacket to eliminate the smell at the cost of ruining it. I'm extremely dissatisfied with this purchase. Beware, if you want a dark colored sherpa just go to the levi store directly. I wanted to purchase another jacket in a different color until this happened. I will not be dealing with the amazon version ever again."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Misled and upset,1.0,"I am highly upset. I’ve been to multiple Levi stores and department stores for this specific jacket. However, at the stores the color is not mustard denim that is a lighter blue but a darker denim. On the amazon description and even the reviewers that post pictures, it also indicated the light blue mustard denim that I needed. I scanned every review and q+a to see if there was an updated inventory that changed the light blue mustard into a darker denim. There was not. Hence, I was misled to buy this jacket that was inaccurately advertised. I spent money, waited for delivery, just to be disappointed, and now it is of great inconvenience because I have to somehow come up with a last minute present or give the present as it is to my son who may be very unsatisfied. I am a big Levi supporter but this is a great disappointment ."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,The jacket fits fine. I was going to buy a size L,5.0,"So I'm a plus size woman. After reading the reviews on the female version of the jacket, i knew that i was not going to fit in one. One of the reviews suggested to buy a male version of the jacket. Which is what I did. The jacket fits fine. I was going to buy a size L, but based on the review i went up a size. The jacket feels just right. The only downside I have is the broad shoulders. The jacket does not curve on my shoulders, its more like a squared look."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,"Beautiful, thick, well made, great looking jackets..... but arms are way too narrow",4.0,"Here is the real deal with these jackets... From the good, the bad, to the unfortunate.The Good:The prices on Amazon for these jackets are amazing! The jackets are beautiful, well made, thick with sherpa insulation in the torso and plenty of thick insulation in the arms. The denim washes are consistent throughout the garment and look just like the pictures you see pictured online. In my opinion they are simply strong, well made, beautiful jackets. I love them.but....The Bad:The arms in these jackets run narrow, so if you have any sort of upper arm musculature they will be tight, too tight. This will force you into buying the next larger size jacket in order to increase the arm width (which is still snug but doable). The problem now is the jacket will be longer and wider in the torso... That's an issue because the jacket simply looks too big, wide, and long!The Solutions:1) Some folks have tried getting around this by buying the larger size, washing and drying in order to shrink the garment (because shrinkage mostly occurs in the length of the arms and torso and a little bit in width), then wear the garment to try and stretch out the denim. Remember it is denim so it will stretch quite a bit just like your jeans do... BUT there is no guarantee it will shrink enough in all the areas you want for a perfect fit..2) You pay a tailor to increase the upper arm width by sewing in extra denim fabric or stretch fabric...3) You go to Sears or a local Levis location and try on a dozen jackets to find one that fits you just right...4) You buy a vintage 70's, 80's, 90's pre-owned jacket which were cut larger in the arms back then...Point is this: If you are tall and slender with slender arms the jacket will fit. If you are overweight with thin arms the jacket will fit. If you are built with a keg like torso and stick like arms the jacket will fit.The Unfortunate:However... If you are athletic in any way and have average muscle size, medium muscles, larger muscles, or huge muscles the jacket will not fit your arms... period. The jacket will fit in the shoulders and the torso but not the arms. Can you see the recurring theme here?My solution:I tried both the large and the XL and neither fit my arms properly and were way too wide and long in the body. (Therefore I had to return them to Amazon.) Unfortunately I ended up going to a local retailer (paid way more than if purchased through amazon) tried on 20+ jackets, got lucky, and found something I could break in. I also bought another one (by going the vintage route via ebay) which worked out even better because they were made bigger and different back then.Great jackets but terrible fit. All Levis needs to do is increase the upper arm width by 1.5 inches in order to compensate for the extra insulation put there. This is why the Sherpa jackets have this sizing problem because the manufacturers are using the pre-existing un-insulated denim jackets as the base model, filling it up with sherpa and arm insulation and....boom....poor fitting jackets."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Great jacket!,5.0,"Ok, so, for starters I'm a woman, ha. I really loved the style of this jacket but I was worried, based on reviews, that the women's version would be a bit too cropped on me, so I thought I would try the men's. I'm tall and thin - 5'9"" 143 pounds. I bought this jacket in a size Medium, which is the size that I would normally fit into in men's clothing. It fits perfectly on me, and falls right where I wanted it to - right about hip length. The sleeves go a little past my wrists, which kinda surprised me because I do have pretty long arms. However, I prefer my sleeves to be a bit longer so I'm happy about that. The upper arms are pretty roomy, though, because obviously this is made for men and I have virtually no upper body musculature, lol. I can see how these jackets might run a tad small for men because even with the little bit of extra room for me to move around in, it's still a very fitted jacket overall.I can layer thicker long sleeve shirts and thin sweatshirts underneath of it and still am able to button it up. But nothing too bulky. This jacket is surprisingly warm, though, thanks to the sherpa lining. The sleeves have a quilted polyamide/polyester lining - certainly not as warm as the body but still pretty decent. I really like the hidden pocket on the inside of the jacket - it's a good size for your phone or wallet. My only complaints, I guess, would be that I wish the front pockets had a sherpa lining as well to keep your hands warm. I'm also not a fan of the snap closure buttons. The color that I ordered - Mustard Blue Denim - is really nice in person and pairs well with darker jeans.Anyway, I think this is a great, warm, handsome jacket that would be well worth buying if you can figure out which size works best for you. I would suggest going with the size you would normally wear in jackets, and if that doesn't fit then try going up a size. Also, consult the size chart on the levi's website as it does seem to be fairly accurate, at least for the size that I bought."

I've tried washing them once and the smell improved just a tiny bit but still very strong and noticeable. I barely wear them now just hanging out on a chair near a window being aired out but no improvement. I don't really want to or should I even have to continously wash/treat the jacket to eliminate the smell at the cost of ruining it. I'm extremely dissatisfied with this purchase. Beware, if you want a dark colored sherpa just go to the levi store directly. I wanted to purchase another jacket in a different color until this happened. I will not be dealing with the amazon version ever again."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Misled and upset,1.0,"I am highly upset. I’ve been to multiple Levi stores and department stores for this specific jacket.

Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,"Beautiful, thick, well made, great looking jackets..... but arms are way too narrow",4.0,"Here is the real deal with these jackets... From the good, the bad, to the unfortunate.The Good:The prices on Amazon for these jackets are amazing! The jackets are beautiful, well made, thick with sherpa insulation in the torso and plenty of thick insulation in the arms. The denim washes are consistent throughout the garment and look just like the pictures you see pictured online. In my opinion they are simply strong, well made, beautiful jackets. I love them.but....The Bad:The arms in these jackets run narrow, so if you have any sort of upper arm musculature they will be tight, too tight. This will force you into buying the next larger size jacket in order to increase the arm width (which is still snug but doable). The problem now is the jacket will be longer and wider in the torso... That's an issue because the jacket simply looks too big, wide, and long!The Solutions:1) Some folks have tried getting around this by buying the larger size, washing and drying in order to shrink the garment (because shrinkage mostly occurs in the length of the arms and torso and a little bit in width), then wear the garment to try and stretch out the denim. Remember it is denim so it will stretch quite a bit just like your jeans do... BUT there is no guarantee it will shrink enough in all the areas you want for a perfect fit..2) You pay a tailor to increase the upper arm width by sewing in extra denim fabric or stretch fabric...3) You go to Sears or a local Levis location and try on a dozen jackets to find one that fits you just right...4) You buy a vintage 70's, 80's, 90's pre-owned jacket which were cut larger in the arms back then...Point is this: If you are tall and slender with slender arms the jacket will fit. If you are overweight with thin arms the jacket will fit. If you are built with a keg like torso and stick like arms the jacket will fit.The Unfortunate:However... If you are athletic in any way and have average muscle size, medium muscles, larger muscles, or huge muscles the jacket will not fit your arms... period. The jacket will fit in the shoulders and the torso but not the arms. Can you see the recurring theme here?My solution:I tried both the large and the XL and neither fit my arms properly and were way too wide and long in the body. (Therefore I had to return them to Amazon.) Unfortunately I ended up going to a local retailer (paid way more than if purchased through amazon) tried on 20+ jackets, got lucky, and found something I could break in. I also bought another one (by going the vintage route via ebay) which worked out even better because they were made bigger and different back then.Great jackets but terrible fit. All Levis needs to do is increase the upper arm width by 1.5 inches in order to compensate for the extra insulation put there. This is why the Sherpa jackets have this sizing problem because the manufacturers are using the pre-existing un-insulated denim jackets as the base model, filling it up with sherpa and arm insulation and....boom....poor fitting jackets."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Great jacket!,5.0,"Ok, so, for starters I'm a woman, ha. I really loved the style of this jacket but I was worried, based on reviews, that the women's version would be a bit too cropped on me, so I thought I would try the men's. I'm tall and thin - 5'9"" 143 pounds. I bought this jacket in a size Medium, which is the size that I would normally fit into in men's clothing. It fits perfectly on me, and falls right where I wanted it to - right about hip length. The sleeves go a little past my wrists, which kinda surprised me because I do have pretty long arms. However, I prefer my sleeves to be a bit longer so I'm happy about that. The upper arms are pretty roomy, though, because obviously this is made for men and I have virtually no upper body musculature, lol. I can see how these jackets might run a tad small for men because even with the little bit of extra room for me to move around in, it's still a very fitted jacket overall.I can layer thicker long sleeve shirts and thin sweatshirts underneath of it and still am able to button it up. But nothing too bulky. This jacket is surprisingly warm, though, thanks to the sherpa lining. The sleeves have a quilted polyamide/polyester lining - certainly not as warm as the body but still pretty decent. I really like the hidden pocket on the inside of the jacket - it's a good size for your phone or wallet. My only complaints, I guess, would be that I wish the front pockets had a sherpa lining as well to keep your hands warm. I'm also not a fan of the snap closure buttons. The color that I ordered - Mustard Blue Denim - is really nice in person and pairs well with darker jeans.Anyway, I think this is a great, warm, handsome jacket that would be well worth buying if you can figure out which size works best for you. I would suggest going with the size you would normally wear in jackets, and if that doesn't fit then try going up a size. Also, consult the size chart on the levi's website as it does seem to be fairly accurate, at least for the size that I bought."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,Great gift!,5.0,"I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and I figured I might as well model it for the review lol. He’s 5’8”, about 180 pounds, and his pant size is a 36X32. I got him the extra large after reading reviews that the arms were small and I’m glad I did because he’s a bit muscular in the arms. This is the same jacket that they’re trying to hock for 3 times the price at urban outfitters. For reference I’m 5’7” and 130 pounds and the color of the jacket bought is mustard blue. I might have to get a matching one for me the quality is super nice and I like the fit better than women’s."

I exchanged for the 3xl and actually was able to get the color I wanted and it fitted perfectly but it's still a fitted jacket and it's suppose to fit tapered to the body with a little wiggle room.So with that being said I am letting you know right now that this style of jacket runs SMALL I say get a size up or two especially if you're on the plushy side if you're skinny or average you MIGHT be able to get away with your size but I recommend sizing up. I am from NY and our winters are pretty cold and with a nice thick hoodie/sweater and this jacket I was nice and warm but that's me...everybody is different.This jacket is super nice in person, I got the Turkish Brown and have received a lot of compliments so far even thou it's a men's jacket! So ladies don't hesitant to buy this item because it's a men's jacket as long as you know how to slay it and make it your own you can wear anything!xoxo"
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,"Great fit - Surprisingly heavy, well made and really good for price",5.0,"I'm 6'1 165 lbs and this jacket (MEDIUM) is absolutely perfect. I have long arms and long legs, see how it fits in opicture. In terms of length this is what this style of Jacket is supposed to be. Very happy with the purchase. It was heavier than expected, which is honestly a great thing. Should work for weathers 50-55 degrees+. Anything colder than that you should get a heavier jacket. Also very comfy and soft on the inside."
Levi's Men's Sherpa Trucker Jacket,"Smaller than expected, still a good jacket",4.0,"I ordered this jacket in a medium thinking that it would be slightly oversized on me, since I am female and most men's clothing tends to run larger on me. Turns out that this jacket delivers a more fitted look, even at this size which really surprised me. The arms are a little stiff, there is just enough wiggle-room but I definitely need to wear this jacket in for a while for it to be comfier. When I button it up, the fit is more snug than I usually like but it's workable, it's just a bit weird because for me there is more room in the waist area but it's tighter around the bottom. This is only a first-impression review, but I do think this seems like a really good quality jacket. I love how the buttons are a snap closure, and I love the color as well, I got the mustard blue shade. I will say though, if you're a guy looking to order this jacket I would suggest ordering several sizes larger than what you are used to, if you don't want it to be too snug. Otherwise maybe just skip this one altogether. I was thinking about returning mine, but I've decided to keep it in hopes that the denim will stretch out a little more the longer I wear it. For reference I'm 5'5"" tall, about 130lbs and the length of this jacket goes down just below my hips, so for a taller person it would probably hit right at the hips or even above that. Overall if you're on the fence about this one like I was, I'd say give it a shot."

Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,"Good, overall fit except for the shoulders",3.0,"I have been surprised by Amazon Essentials' sizing of jackets I have tried recently. Never had I considered the brand before until I had the opportunity to try a few garments. When I saw this jacket become available, I was excited. I wanted a lightweight one that would look great and not be too hot to wear. Unfortunately, it did not meet my expectations.Before I go into the details, allow me to share the advantages and disadvantages of the material this jacket is made of: 100% Polyester.Polyester has many advantages and disadvantages, and it is most widely used for active wear.Polyester PROS- Does not shrink as much- Quick drying- Inexpensive- Flexible and strong (does not need ironing)- ComfortablePolyester CONS- Not as breathable as cotton- In general, when wet it could stick to your body (but not with this jacket)Jacket PROS- Inherent with Polyester, it feels great- Is slightly shiny (some may consider this a negative)- Slightly waterproof- Warm enough for cool weather (but too thin for extreme cold)- Good fit, except for the belly area where it tapers more widely open: this can accentuate a bigger belly and make you look fatter- Looks great with the right person and body typeJacket CONS- Definitely is not a bomber jacket. It draws INSPIRATION from one instead- Feels tight at the shoulder blades when crossing my arms- Belly area opens more widely in the open position, accentuating a bigger belly more and make you look fatter- With certain body types, it can make you look older than you areOverall, this jacket seems well made, has a decent fit (except for the shoulder blades area when crossing my arms), and can look great on the right type of person and body type. This jacket, however, is not for me."

For some reason, it's really tight around the biceps, especially when stretching your arms forward.  I do not have large biceps.  So, it won't pass the ""bear test"" (don't have quite enough mobility to fight a bear) so I'll be sending it back.Also, the blue is a lot darker than I expected.  Maybe not quite navy, but a lot darker than the bright blue pictured.  Which is fine, because it makes it a little more understated and I actually kind of like it.All that being said, for $14, it looks nice and it'll definitely keep the wind off your back in cool weather."

Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,Nicer than I expected,5.0,"I had a certain expectation for an Amazon branded jacket, but was pleasantly surprised when this arrived.  It feels like it is made of nice quality materials for a wind breaker.  The only complaint I have is that the liner gets caught in the zipper pretty frequently, but it pulls out easily so not too much of an issue.  This might wear the material out in the future but for now, there are no issues.  I've enjoyed wearing this on spring days and look forward to wearing it on summer evenings."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,My Wife Likes It,5.0,"In an effort to dress like a mature man in his late 30s instead of wearing my clothes like I did a few decades ago (buying clothes that were two sizes too big), I picked up this light bomber jacket and it fits and looks great. (Why do they call it a ""bomber jacket""?) It fits as expected and my wife made the comment that she's gonna have to step her game up since I was so fashion forward. For context, I bought the Large for my 5'11"", 194 lbs body."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,"Good, overall fit except for the shoulders",3.0,"I have been surprised by Amazon Essentials' sizing of jackets I have tried recently. Never had I considered the brand before until I had the opportunity to try a few garments. When I saw this jacket become available, I was excited. I wanted a lightweight one that would look great and not be too hot to wear. Unfortunately, it did not meet my expectations.Before I go into the details, allow me to share the advantages and disadvantages of the material this jacket is made of: 100% Polyester.Polyester has many advantages and disadvantages, and it is most widely used for active wear.Polyester PROS- Does not shrink as much- Quick drying- Inexpensive- Flexible and strong (does not need ironing)- ComfortablePolyester CONS- Not as breathable as cotton- In general, when wet it could stick to your body (but not with this jacket)Jacket PROS- Inherent with Polyester, it feels great- Is slightly shiny (some may consider this a negative)- Slightly waterproof- Warm enough for cool weather (but too thin for extreme cold)- Good fit, except for the belly area where it tapers more widely open: this can accentuate a bigger belly and make you look fatter- Looks great with the right person and body typeJacket CONS- Definitely is not a bomber jacket. It draws INSPIRATION from one instead- Feels tight at the shoulder blades when crossing my arms- Belly area opens more widely in the open position, accentuating a bigger belly more and make you look fatter- With certain body types, it can make you look older than you areOverall, this jacket seems well made, has a decent fit (except for the shoulder blades area when crossing my arms), and can look great on the right type of person and body type. This jacket, however, is not for me."

Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,On the fence,4.0,"I'm 6 foot and weight 175 pounds and bought a Large. I like the material, the weight is perfect for spring/fall. It's a nice looking jacket at a good price.  Like so many clothes I buy on amazon, the fit is slightly off but everything else is on point so I don't know if i should return it or not.  It's a little tight in the chest. I lift weights and my chest has some bulk.  If I was trying this out in the store, I probably would put it aside and see if I could find something better.  I'd settle for it if i couldn't.  It really is a nice looking jacket and would probably fit most guys my size"

It's a little snug around the waist and the bottom elastic isn't super stretchy.  The material doesn't stretch much at all.  For some reason, it's really tight around the biceps, especially when stretching your arms forward.  I do not have large biceps.  So, it won't pass the ""bear test"" (don't have quite enough mobility to fight a bear) so I'll be sending it back.Also, the blue is a lot darker than I expected.  Maybe not quite navy, but a lot darker than the bright blue pictured.  Which is fine, because it makes it a little more understated and I actually kind of like it.All that being said, for $14, it looks nice and it'll definitely keep the wind off your back in cool weather."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,"Nice to look at, hell to work in.",3.0,"Good for looks, and quick trips. Tends to bunch up around the shoulders, if you trying to work anywhere shoulder level, or above."

Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,Nicer than I expected,5.0,"I had a certain expectation for an Amazon branded jacket, but was pleasantly surprised when this arrived.  It feels like it is made of nice quality materials for a wind breaker.  The only complaint I have is that the liner gets caught in the zipper pretty frequently, but it pulls out easily so not too much of an issue.  This might wear the material out in the future but for now, there are no issues.  I've enjoyed wearing this on spring days and look forward to wearing it on summer evenings."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,My Wife Likes It,5.0,"In an effort to dress like a mature man in his late 30s instead of wearing my clothes like I did a few decades ago (buying clothes that were two sizes too big), I picked up this light bomber jacket and it fits and looks great. (Why do they call it a ""bomber jacket""?) It fits as expected and my wife made the comment that she's gonna have to step her game up since I was so fashion forward. For context, I bought the Large for my 5'11"", 194 lbs body."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,"Good, overall fit except for the shoulders",3.0,"I have been surprised by Amazon Essentials' sizing of jackets I have tried recently. Never had I considered the brand before until I had the opportunity to try a few garments. When I saw this jacket become available, I was excited. I wanted a lightweight one that would look great and not be too hot to wear. Unfortunately, it did not meet my expectations.Before I go into the details, allow me to share the advantages and disadvantages of the material this jacket is made of: 100% Polyester.Polyester has many advantages and disadvantages, and it is most widely used for active wear.Polyester PROS- Does not shrink as much- Quick drying- Inexpensive- Flexible and strong (does not need ironing)- ComfortablePolyester CONS- Not as breathable as cotton- In general, when wet it could stick to your body (but not with this jacket)Jacket PROS- Inherent with Polyester, it feels great- Is slightly shiny (some may consider this a negative)- Slightly waterproof- Warm enough for cool weather (but too thin for extreme cold)- Good fit, except for the belly area where it tapers more widely open: this can accentuate a bigger belly and make you look fatter- Looks great with the right person and body typeJacket CONS- Definitely is not a bomber jacket. It draws INSPIRATION from one instead- Feels tight at the shoulder blades when crossing my arms- Belly area opens more widely in the open position, accentuating a bigger belly more and make you look fatter- With certain body types, it can make you look older than you areOverall, this jacket seems well made, has a decent fit (except for the shoulder blades area when crossing my arms), and can look great on the right type of person and body type. This jacket, however, is not for me."

Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,On the fence,4.0,"I'm 6 foot and weight 175 pounds and bought a Large. I like the material, the weight is perfect for spring/fall. It's a nice looking jacket at a good price.  Like so many clothes I buy on amazon, the fit is slightly off but everything else is on point so I don't know if i should return it or not.  It's a little tight in the chest. I lift weights and my chest has some bulk.  If I was trying this out in the store, I probably would put it aside and see if I could find something better.  I'd settle for it if i couldn't.  It really is a nice looking jacket and would probably fit most guys my size"

Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,This jacket is too noisy when I walk.,1.0,"The sleeves make a loud sound when they brush against my sides when I walk. It sounds really cheap. The sleeves seem fine when my arms are at my sides, but if lift my arms up to reach for something, the sleeves suddenly feel tight."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,"Won't be fighting any bears.  Little snug, but decent jacket for $14",3.0,"Ordered the XL.  I'm 5'8, 240lb.  It's a little snug around the waist and the bottom elastic isn't super stretchy.  The material doesn't stretch much at all.  For some reason, it's really tight around the biceps, especially when stretching your arms forward.  I do not have large biceps.  So, it won't pass the ""bear test"" (don't have quite enough mobility to fight a bear) so I'll be sending it back.Also, the blue is a lot darker than I expected.  Maybe not quite navy, but a lot darker than the bright blue pictured.  Which is fine, because it makes it a little more understated and I actually kind of like it.All that being said, for $14, it looks nice and it'll definitely keep the wind off your back in cool weather."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,"Nice to look at, hell to work in.",3.0,"Good for looks, and quick trips. Tends to bunch up around the shoulders, if you trying to work anywhere shoulder level, or above."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,AMAZING!!,5.0,Absolutely LOVED this bomber jacket!! I wore it for a photoshoot and got tons of compliments!!
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,Nicer than I expected,5.0,"I had a certain expectation for an Amazon branded jacket, but was pleasantly surprised when this arrived.  It feels like it is made of nice quality materials for a wind breaker.  The only complaint I have is that the liner gets caught in the zipper pretty frequently, but it pulls out easily so not too much of an issue.  This might wear the material out in the future but for now, there are no issues.  I've enjoyed wearing this on spring days and look forward to wearing it on summer evenings."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,My Wife Likes It,5.0,"In an effort to dress like a mature man in his late 30s instead of wearing my clothes like I did a few decades ago (buying clothes that were two sizes too big), I picked up this light bomber jacket and it fits and looks great. (Why do they call it a ""bomber jacket""?) It fits as expected and my wife made the comment that she's gonna have to step her game up since I was so fashion forward. For context, I bought the Large for my 5'11"", 194 lbs body."
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,"Good, overall fit except for the shoulders",3.0,"I have been surprised by Amazon Essentials' sizing of jackets I have tried recently. Never had I considered the brand before until I had the opportunity to try a few garments. When I saw this jacket become available, I was excited. I wanted a lightweight one that would look great and not be too hot to wear. Unfortunately, it did not meet my expectations.Before I go into the details, allow me to share the advantages and disadvantages of the material this jacket is made of: 100% Polyester.Polyester has many advantages and disadvantages, and it is most widely used for active wear.Polyester PROS- Does not shrink as much- Quick drying- Inexpensive- Flexible and strong (does not need ironing)- ComfortablePolyester CONS- Not as breathable as cotton- In general, when wet it could stick to your body (but not with this jacket)Jacket PROS- Inherent with Polyester, it feels great- Is slightly shiny (some may consider this a negative)- Slightly waterproof- Warm enough for cool weather (but too thin for extreme cold)- Good fit, except for the belly area where it tapers more widely open: this can accentuate a bigger belly and make you look fatter- Looks great with the right person and body typeJacket CONS- Definitely is not a bomber jacket. It draws INSPIRATION from one instead- Feels tight at the shoulder blades when crossing my arms- Belly area opens more widely in the open position, accentuating a bigger belly more and make you look fatter- With certain body types, it can make you look older than you areOverall, this jacket seems well made, has a decent fit (except for the shoulder blades area when crossing my arms), and can look great on the right type of person and body type. This jacket, however, is not for me."

Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,Comfortable and Stylish,5.0,LOVE THIS JACKET!!! I bought it because I had an idea in my head and it definitely came through for me! I was really surprised at the quality....like OKAY Amazon!!
Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Bomber Jacket,On the fence,4.0,"I'm 6 foot and weight 175 pounds and bought a Large. I like the material, the weight is perfect for spring/fall. It's a nice looking jacket at a good price.  Like so many clothes I buy on amazon, the fit is slightly off but everything else is on point so I don't know if i should return it or not.  It's a little tight in the chest. I lift weights and my chest has some bulk.  If I was trying this out in the store, I probably would put it aside and see if I could find something better.

EKLENTSON Fleece Jacket Men Military Jacket Men Casual Jacket Lightweight Ski Jacket Men Army Jacket for Men Fashion Khaki,The Perfect Jacket,5.0,"I have bought two of these Jackets, this one, 'Desert Tan', and the 'Army Green'. Thinking about buying the 'Black' one? The colors are True! For me, these are the Perfect Jacket! Not to heavy, not a light Jacket. Warm for a 'chilly' day or night. The Fit is just what I was looking for. Not Tight, not Baggie. What I would describe as 'Snug'. I have 'Room to move'. They fit just fine with a single shirt/T-shirt/polo shirt/sweat shirt/sweater on, and I could wear a 'Hoodie' underneath if I wanted to, for those colder days/nights. I'm 5'10"", 205 Lbs, 42"" Chest, I bought size Large. Excellent wind breaker. The Style is 'Military', and I do get many compliments for these Jackets. The waste sits just below my belt line and the cuffs at my wrests. The two hand pockets are deep. I can get my hands in the pockets just past my wrests. All the other pockets, two chest and one inside, are functional. The Jacket Zipper is reversed, on the left, that makes no difference to me and I could care less. It works!!! The durability is Excellent and they are Well constructed. I'll put that to the test when I wear these camping/hiking up in the mountains, out in the desert and boondocks!!!! So far though, The Perfect Jacket!!! Note; I am NOT compensated in any way, shape or form for my review! I give a straight-up, honest review of the products that I buy!!! If it was junk, I'd say so!!!"

EKLENTSON Fleece Jacket Men Military Jacket Men Casual Jacket Lightweight Ski Jacket Men Army Jacket for Men Fashion Khaki,100% worth the money; very well made!,5.0,"Bought this for a friend and he absolutely loves it. It is very high quality material and seems really well made. Fits just as expected and looks awesome! The inside of the torso portion is lined with really soft faux fur/plush material so I think it would be really good in cold weather but it hasn't been super cold here since I bought it. Only the torso being lined I believe would provide the warmth you need while not making you sweat in the underarms (which, as someone who overheats easily, is a problem I often run into with fully lined coats). Definitely recommend this! Money well spent :)"

EKLENTSON Fleece Jacket Men Military Jacket Men Casual Jacket Lightweight Ski Jacket Men Army Jacket for Men Fashion Khaki,The Perfect Jacket,5.0,"I have bought two of these Jackets, this one, 'Desert Tan', and the 'Army Green'. Thinking about buying the 'Black' one? The colors are True! For me, these are the Perfect Jacket! Not to heavy, not a light Jacket. Warm for a 'chilly' day or night. The Fit is just what I was looking for. Not Tight, not Baggie. What I would describe as 'Snug'. I have 'Room to move'. They fit just fine with a single shirt/T-shirt/polo shirt/sweat shirt/sweater on, and I could wear a 'Hoodie' underneath if I wanted to, for those colder days/nights. I'm 5'10"", 205 Lbs, 42"" Chest, I bought size Large. Excellent wind breaker. The Style is 'Military', and I do get many compliments for these Jackets. The waste sits just below my belt line and the cuffs at my wrests. The two hand pockets are deep. I can get my hands in the pockets just past my wrests. All the other pockets, two chest and one inside, are functional. The Jacket Zipper is reversed, on the left, that makes no difference to me and I could care less. It works!!! The durability is Excellent and they are Well constructed. I'll put that to the test when I wear these camping/hiking up in the mountains, out in the desert and boondocks!!!! So far though, The Perfect Jacket!!! Note; I am NOT compensated in any way, shape or form for my review! I give a straight-up, honest review of the products that I buy!!! If it was junk, I'd say so!!!"

EKLENTSON Fleece Jacket Men Military Jacket Men Casual Jacket Lightweight Ski Jacket Men Army Jacket for Men Fashion Khaki,100% worth the money; very well made!,5.0,"Bought this for a friend and he absolutely loves it. It is very high quality material and seems really well made. Fits just as expected and looks awesome! The inside of the torso portion is lined with really soft faux fur/plush material so I think it would be really good in cold weather but it hasn't been super cold here since I bought it. Only the torso being lined I believe would provide the warmth you need while not making you sweat in the underarms (which, as someone who overheats easily, is a problem I often run into with fully lined coats). Definitely recommend this! Money well spent :)"

Looks nice. 2xl is small in the arms and waist. 5'7"" and 275 needed at least a 3xl (not offered). Will be a hand me down to son. Will keep looking for better multi pocket field jacket."

EKLENTSON Fleece Jacket Men Military Jacket Men Casual Jacket Lightweight Ski Jacket Men Army Jacket for Men Fashion Khaki,Not really worth it,1.0,I bought this jacket in the same size as the lighter weight jacket that fits perfectly and... this is too small in the shoulders and the waist. Pretty disappointed. Also got a different color than what I ordered.
EKLENTSON Fleece Jacket Men Military Jacket Men Casual Jacket Lightweight Ski Jacket Men Army Jacket for Men Fashion Khaki,Great well made jacket and great price,5.0,"My son wearing large size, but I bought an extra large for his Christmas present, and he loves it.

EKLENTSON Fleece Jacket Men Military Jacket Men Casual Jacket Lightweight Ski Jacket Men Army Jacket for Men Fashion Khaki,The Perfect Jacket,5.0,"I have bought two of these Jackets, this one, 'Desert Tan', and the 'Army Green'. Thinking about buying the 'Black' one? The colors are True! For me, these are the Perfect Jacket! Not to heavy, not a light Jacket. Warm for a 'chilly' day or night. The Fit is just what I was looking for. Not Tight, not Baggie. What I would describe as 'Snug'. I have 'Room to move'. They fit just fine with a single shirt/T-shirt/polo shirt/sweat shirt/sweater on, and I could wear a 'Hoodie' underneath if I wanted to, for those colder days/nights. I'm 5'10"", 205 Lbs, 42"" Chest, I bought size Large. Excellent wind breaker. The Style is 'Military', and I do get many compliments for these Jackets. The waste sits just below my belt line and the cuffs at my wrests. The two hand pockets are deep. I can get my hands in the pockets just past my wrests. All the other pockets, two chest and one inside, are functional. The Jacket Zipper is reversed, on the left, that makes no difference to me and I could care less. It works!!! The durability is Excellent and they are Well constructed. I'll put that to the test when I wear these camping/hiking up in the mountains, out in the desert and boondocks!!!! So far though, The Perfect Jacket!!! Note; I am NOT compensated in any way, shape or form for my review! I give a straight-up, honest review of the products that I buy!!! If it was junk, I'd say so!!!"

EKLENTSON Fleece Jacket Men Military Jacket Men Casual Jacket Lightweight Ski Jacket Men Army Jacket for Men Fashion Khaki,100% worth the money; very well made!,5.0,"Bought this for a friend and he absolutely loves it. It is very high quality material and seems really well made. Fits just as expected and looks awesome! The inside of the torso portion is lined with really soft faux fur/plush material so I think it would be really good in cold weather but it hasn't been super cold here since I bought it. Only the torso being lined I believe would provide the warmth you need while not making you sweat in the underarms (which, as someone who overheats easily, is a problem I often run into with fully lined coats). Definitely recommend this! Money well spent :)"

Columbia Men's Granite Mountain Fleece Jacket,COUNTERFEIT JACKET SOLD!,1.0,"First, I'm writing this review almost 2 months late here due to having an extremely busy holiday season, so I haven't had the chance to bother filing a return when I immediately noticed the new jacket I purchased is not the same quality as my old official Columbia jacket I still own. But I'm so frustrated with this loss, that at least I can leave a review to let others know the downgrade of this jacket.**In the photo: Fake Jacket (Left Side) and Official Jacket (Right Side)I own the same Columbia Jacket bought 5 years ago and still have it, and it's amazing!  This new jacket I've received, the fleece material has a thin, see-through, cheap knock-off feel. The original has a heavier-denser fleece material. The main front logo on the new jacket is a tag stitched on the wearer's left side versus official embroidered logo on the wearers right side. The original side pocket zipper zips upwards to open. The new jacket side pocket zips downwards to open. The original has a bungee cord to tighten the bottom jacket's waist level, and this new one doesn't have any bungee cord (this could be a product change feature though)."
Columbia Men's Granite Mountain Fleece Jacket,Not the quality I expected,3.0,"I ordered both a black and navy blue fleece. Received the items in a very prompt manner. I have been buying Columbia fleeces for the past 30 years and was replacing some I already had purchased directly from a Columbia store. The material in these current  fleeces I purchased  was not the usual plush Columbia fleece material I have purchased in the past. It was much thinner, slightly heavier than a flannel shirt. The colors were also not what I expected. The black was more of a dark grey and the navy blue more of a medium blue. I returned both. I still would recommend this  seller  because of their professionalism in handling my return.  I received my refund in a day , even before the return package had reached them. I was disappointed in the quality of the merchandise but I wouldn't  say the seller misled me with the description."
Columbia Men's Granite Mountain Fleece Jacket,"Warm, comfortable",5.0,"Nice warm jacket. I have an unlined canvas jacket that i needed a liner for during cold weather. I wanted it short enough so it doesn't hang below the jacket. This is perfect. I had a columbia bugaboo jacket years ago with an almost identical fleece zip out liner and i wore just the liner more than the jacket. Very nice, comfortable, quality as good at the one in my old jacket. I am 5'8"" weigh 150 lbs and the small is a good fit. I tried a medium first and it was a little large through the chest."
Columbia Men's Granite Mountain Fleece Jacket,Nice jacket,5.0,"I ordered this jacket maybe a year ago and have since lost it.  It fit really well.  I'm tall(ish) so I worry about the length of arms and the waist being too high, but this had extra length in both those areas without being baggy. It was also super soft.  One downside is that the Columbia logo is a separate piece of fabric that's sewed on.  It's not something I would have really thought about until I read about someone having the preference for an embroidered logo (which I can understand).  Overall, I really liked it (and miss it) and would definitely recommend it."
Columbia Men's Granite Mountain Fleece Jacket,No embroidered logo!,3.0,Jacket fits nice and feels nice. I’m 5’9”/5’10” and 250 lbs. I got a size XL. Only complaint is I don’t think Columbia makes these styled fleeces with the embroidered logo anymore.  I made an exchange  and complaint about the sewn logo only to receive another one just like it. Even though the item description on Amazon says “embroidered logo”.  I went to the Columbia website and all over the internet to look for this style fleece with the embroidered logo but found nothing. Otherwise this fleece will do for now.
Columbia Men's Granite Mountain Fleece Jacket,Husband loves it,5.0,Bought this jacket for my husband and he LOVES it. He's from California so he's a bit of a baby in the cold weather where we live now and it even keeps him warm. Very impressed. Thinking of buying myself one so I don't steal his lol
Columbia Men's Granite Mountain Fleece Jacket,Handmade felt jacket would be warmer than this.,2.0,I bought this for my boyfriend as a replacement for a similar one in a different brand because anything I’ve ever purchased from Columbia has been great. This looks just like the photo and fits true to size but it would honestly be warmer to make a jacket out of felt from a craft store than this. I wore this in Florida on a “cool night” and my thin PJ pants were warmer than this. Very disappointing and now can’t return as we have already thrown the tags out. Would not recommend for warmth other than maybe being a bit cold in an office? If that...
Columbia Men's Granite Mountain Fleece Jacket,Not as pictured,2.0,I bought this to replace an older Columbia fleece cause I broke the drawstring at the bottom. The fleece is not as pictured in the listing. The Columbia logo is a patch not embroidered and the fleece material is thinner.

Columbia Men's Granite Mountain Fleece Jacket,Colombia Fleece,2.0,"Overall, the fleece does the job. The ‘Colombia’ logo is not embroidered like described. It’s a stitched on patch.

This looks just like the photo and fits true to size but it would honestly be warmer to make a jacket out of felt from a craft store than this. I wore this in Florida on a “cool night” and my thin PJ pants were warmer than this. Very disappointing and now can’t return as we have already thrown the tags out. Would not recommend for warmth other than maybe being a bit cold in an office? If that...
Columbia Men's Granite Mountain Fleece Jacket,Not as pictured,2.0,I bought this to replace an older Columbia fleece cause I broke the drawstring at the bottom. The fleece is not as pictured in the listing. The Columbia logo is a patch not embroidered and the fleece material is thinner.
Columbia Men's Granite Mountain Fleece Jacket,Counterfeit Item,1.0,"100% counterfeit and most comments here say so. No idea why it’s even allowed to be sold on here. The logo isn’t embroidered, so it’s very easy to tell…. Gave it one star because it is totally fake.. but it’s warm, fits right, and will at least be good for my 2 week travel across the country. You should probably spend your money on real Columbia though"
Columbia Men's Granite Mountain Fleece Jacket,Colombia Fleece,2.0,"Overall, the fleece does the job. The ‘Colombia’ logo is not embroidered like described. It’s a stitched on patch. Color isn’t as black as I would have liked, probably more of a charcoal color. Fits ok. Keeping it just because of the prime deal I received on it."
Columbia Men's Granite Mountain Fleece Jacket,COUNTERFEIT JACKET SOLD!,1.0,"First, I'm writing this review almost 2 months late here due to having an extremely busy holiday season, so I haven't had the chance to bother filing a return when I immediately noticed the new jacket I purchased is not the same quality as my old official Columbia jacket I still own. But I'm so frustrated with this loss, that at least I can leave a review to let others know the downgrade of this jacket.**In the photo: Fake Jacket (Left Side) and Official Jacket (Right Side)I own the same Columbia Jacket bought 5 years ago and still have it, and it's amazing!  This new jacket I've received, the fleece material has a thin, see-through, cheap knock-off feel. The original has a heavier-denser fleece material. The main front logo on the new jacket is a tag stitched on the wearer's left side versus official embroidered logo on the wearers right side. The original side pocket zipper zips upwards to open. The new jacket side pocket zips downwards to open. The original has a bungee cord to tighten the bottom jacket's waist level, and this new one doesn't have any bungee cord (this could be a product change feature though)."
Columbia Men's Granite Mountain Fleece Jacket,Not the quality I expected,3.0,"I ordered both a black and navy blue fleece. Received the items in a very prompt manner. I have been buying Columbia fleeces for the past 30 years and was replacing some I already had purchased directly from a Columbia store. The material in these current  fleeces I purchased  was not the usual plush Columbia fleece material I have purchased in the past. It was much thinner, slightly heavier than a flannel shirt. The colors were also not what I expected. The black was more of a dark grey and the navy blue more of a medium blue. I returned both. I still would recommend this  seller  because of their professionalism in handling my return.  I received my refund in a day , even before the return package had reached them. I was disappointed in the quality of the merchandise but I wouldn't  say the seller misled me with the description."
Columbia Men's Granite Mountain Fleece Jacket,"Warm, comfortable",5.0,"Nice warm jacket. I have an unlined canvas jacket that i needed a liner for during cold weather. I wanted it short enough so it doesn't hang below the jacket. This is perfect. I had a columbia bugaboo jacket years ago with an almost identical fleece zip out liner and i wore just the liner more than the jacket. Very nice, comfortable, quality as good at the one in my old jacket. I am 5'8"" weigh 150 lbs and the small is a good fit. I tried a medium first and it was a little large through the chest."
Columbia Men's Granite Mountain Fleece Jacket,Nice jacket,5.0,"I ordered this jacket maybe a year ago and have since lost it.  It fit really well.  I'm tall(ish) so I worry about the length of arms and the waist being too high, but this had extra length in both those areas without being baggy. It was also super soft.  One downside is that the Columbia logo is a separate piece of fabric that's sewed on.  It's not something I would have really thought about until I read about someone having the preference for an embroidered logo (which I can understand).  Overall, I really liked it (and miss it) and would definitely recommend it."
Columbia Men's Granite Mountain Fleece Jacket,No embroidered logo!,3.0,Jacket fits nice and feels nice. I’m 5’9”/5’10” and 250 lbs. I got a size XL. Only complaint is I don’t think Columbia makes these styled fleeces with the embroidered logo anymore.  I made an exchange  and complaint about the sewn logo only to receive another one just like it. Even though the item description on Amazon says “embroidered logo”.  I went to the Columbia website and all over the internet to look for this style fleece with the embroidered logo but found nothing. Otherwise this fleece will do for now.

Columbia Men's Granite Mountain Fleece Jacket,Nice jacket,5.0,"I ordered this jacket maybe a year ago and have since lost it.  It fit really well.  I'm tall(ish) so I worry about the length of arms and the waist being too high, but this had extra length in both those areas without being baggy. It was also super soft.  One downside is that the Columbia logo is a separate piece of fabric that's sewed on.  It's not something I would have really thought about until I read about someone having the preference for an embroidered logo (which I can understand).  Overall, I really liked it (and miss it) and would definitely recommend it."
Columbia Men's Granite Mountain Fleece Jacket,No embroidered logo!,3.0,Jacket fits nice and feels nice. I’m 5’9”/5’10” and 250 lbs. I got a size XL. Only complaint is I don’t think Columbia makes these styled fleeces with the embroidered logo anymore.  I made an exchange  and complaint about the sewn logo only to receive another one just like it. Even though the item description on Amazon says “embroidered logo”.  I went to the Columbia website and all over the internet to look for this style fleece with the embroidered logo but found nothing. Otherwise this fleece will do for now.

Columbia Men's Granite Mountain Fleece Jacket,Handmade felt jacket would be warmer than this.,2.0,I bought this for my boyfriend as a replacement for a similar one in a different brand because anything I’ve ever purchased from Columbia has been great.

Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,GO WITH YOUR GUT!!,5.0,"Fits perfectly - I purchased a Medium. I’m 180 lbs, 6 feet tall, regular semi athletic build. I can wear it with a hoodie or flannel underneath and it looks great. It’s supposed to be a little snug.  I only read two or three reviews that told me to “go with my gut” and hundreds of other reviews that told me to size up to a large. I’m glad I didn’t listen to the masses on this one. I think the disagreement stems from 3 issues:- People aren’t sure how these are supposed to fit: the sleeves are supposed to come down to your wrists and the bottom should rest at the top of your waist at your belt line. It should feel snug some areas, or else it loses the edgy look.- I think there are lots of muscular guys with huge biceps buying mediums or smalls, OR very large men buying larges. If you have really big biceps, or are just a large person altogether, you may need to size up. If you fall with in typical sizes, go with your typical sizes.- Some might be 100% cotton and some have 2% Elasane (spandex); I think the 2% can make a huge difference in how it fits/stretches out. The one I bought was a “stretch” which means it had that 2%. Maybe they all have this? I’m not sure.In sum, if you over 6 feet tall and over 180lb, use the sizing chart and *maybe* size up. I’m very happy with mine. Can’t stop wearing it!"
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Best Review,5.0,"If you need to know your size, go to Levi's website and look up your measurements for jackets and it'll be fairly accurate. I'm about 5'10"" 185lbs~ and I went to their website, measured my chest (about 42-43"") and my waist (about 33"") and it said to get medium, so I bought a medium and the fit is nearly perfect. If you want a baggier jacket, I recommend going up a size from what it tells you, but if you're like me and want a slimmer fitting jacket, the measurements should be pretty accurate. If you do go with the slimmer fit and you want to wear a hoodie underneath the jacket, just know that it'll be pretty snug. But for wearing with just a normal shirt, it'll be great. Now onto the actual jacket. Everything is great about it except for two small things. 1. The sleeves are just a tad bit too long for me, but it's not bad. 2. There were some random wear marks in the jacket. Also, not a big deal. So far, I love it and I recommend it."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Size alert,1.0,"Very disappointed with the sizing on this jacket. I normally order a 2 extra large tall in jackets and shirts. This item did not have that size to select from but it did have a 3 xl so my thinking was that it would probably work.  It turned out to not even be close. The sleeves are too short and too small in diameter, the jacket is too short, the shoulders are too narrow and the jacket will not button. It's undersized in every aspect. I'm guessing that it probably would work well if a person wore a large/extra large but certainly not any larger than that. The tag in the jacket says 3 extra large, but it most assuredly is not."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,No Snake Arms Here,2.0,"I've been worn Levi's products, including the jackets in question, for about 55 years now. I'm pretty used to how their sizing runs. Until now, that is. I read some reviews before making this purchase, so I bought a size larger than I would have thought, an XXL. What I got was a jacket that barely fit anywhere, and the arms didn't fit except in length. I'm not a muscular guy, and I can just imagine the circus getting the jacket on if I was. Levi's has obviously decided that their future is with thin hipster's and not us plain old working folk. Okay, so be it."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,"For the ladies, too!",4.0,"I bought a men's jacket so I'd be able to layer, and to have a longer cut. The ladies jackets seem to be cut really short and are very fitted. I'm 145lbs 5'7"" with wide hips and a small fits pretty well, considering it's a men's cut. It has the loose fit I was aiming for  but it is pretty tight in the hips. I usually wear a size 6 bottoms, and I can't button the bottom two buttons. I don't mind it though, because I don't plan to ever wear it buttoned up. I'm very narrow in the shoulders, so the breast of the jacket and the arm holes are a little large. Again, not bothered, because it will give me room to put a Hoodie under it in cooler weather. This is straight up classic denim, so there's no stretch, but it's also not too stiff. It's just right."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,The Classic Denim Jacket,5.0,"Fifty years ago, this was the classic denim jacket for guys...as it still is today.It is a light weight to wear in all seasons...over a tee shirt on a summer night, over a sweater on a winter afternoon.Many people want their denim jacket to fit like a snug, tight shirt.  I prefer a looser fit to wear over a thick sweater.  I am 5'10"", 180 pounds.  A medium would be tight and the cuffs would be above my wrists.  I got the large size, which fits loosely over a tee shirt and the sleeves cover my wrists.I like the loose/long fit so I wash the jacket in cold water and line dry.  If I wanted to shorten the sleeves, I'm guessing that a hot water wash and a hot dryer might take an inch off the sleeves.When your jacket is new you should wear it everyday until iteventually takes on the shape of your body. In a few months it will fit like a glove."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,If you have even a tiny bit of muscle consider ordering a size up,1.0,"Bought this jacket for my father who is a x-large in all shirts, jackets, and coats he has ever worn. However, this jacket was two small in the arms and thru the shoulders and chest.

Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Does not run true to u.s. sizes!,1.0,"This apparently runs in Bangladeshi sizes- this would be appropriate, because that's where it's made.

As a 6 foot 230 pound person, I typically wear 2xl in most all clothing. This jacket came labeled a 2xl, however it was about 2 sizes too small. Making This literally a u.s. large?

Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Now this is a “Boyfriend” Style Jacket,5.0,"I was looking for an oversized jacket to wear with certain outfits - this time to wear over a hockey jersey.

Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,GO WITH YOUR GUT!!,5.0,"Fits perfectly - I purchased a Medium. I’m 180 lbs, 6 feet tall, regular semi athletic build. I can wear it with a hoodie or flannel underneath and it looks great. It’s supposed to be a little snug.  I only read two or three reviews that told me to “go with my gut” and hundreds of other reviews that told me to size up to a large. I’m glad I didn’t listen to the masses on this one. I think the disagreement stems from 3 issues:- People aren’t sure how these are supposed to fit: the sleeves are supposed to come down to your wrists and the bottom should rest at the top of your waist at your belt line. It should feel snug some areas, or else it loses the edgy look.- I think there are lots of muscular guys with huge biceps buying mediums or smalls, OR very large men buying larges. If you have really big biceps, or are just a large person altogether, you may need to size up. If you fall with in typical sizes, go with your typical sizes.- Some might be 100% cotton and some have 2% Elasane (spandex); I think the 2% can make a huge difference in how it fits/stretches out. The one I bought was a “stretch” which means it had that 2%. Maybe they all have this? I’m not sure.In sum, if you over 6 feet tall and over 180lb, use the sizing chart and *maybe* size up. I’m very happy with mine. Can’t stop wearing it!"
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Best Review,5.0,"If you need to know your size, go to Levi's website and look up your measurements for jackets and it'll be fairly accurate. I'm about 5'10"" 185lbs~ and I went to their website, measured my chest (about 42-43"") and my waist (about 33"") and it said to get medium, so I bought a medium and the fit is nearly perfect. If you want a baggier jacket, I recommend going up a size from what it tells you, but if you're like me and want a slimmer fitting jacket, the measurements should be pretty accurate. If you do go with the slimmer fit and you want to wear a hoodie underneath the jacket, just know that it'll be pretty snug. But for wearing with just a normal shirt, it'll be great. Now onto the actual jacket. Everything is great about it except for two small things. 1. The sleeves are just a tad bit too long for me, but it's not bad. 2. There were some random wear marks in the jacket. Also, not a big deal. So far, I love it and I recommend it."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Size alert,1.0,"Very disappointed with the sizing on this jacket. I normally order a 2 extra large tall in jackets and shirts. This item did not have that size to select from but it did have a 3 xl so my thinking was that it would probably work.  It turned out to not even be close. The sleeves are too short and too small in diameter, the jacket is too short, the shoulders are too narrow and the jacket will not button. It's undersized in every aspect. I'm guessing that it probably would work well if a person wore a large/extra large but certainly not any larger than that. The tag in the jacket says 3 extra large, but it most assuredly is not."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,No Snake Arms Here,2.0,"I've been worn Levi's products, including the jackets in question, for about 55 years now. I'm pretty used to how their sizing runs. Until now, that is. I read some reviews before making this purchase, so I bought a size larger than I would have thought, an XXL. What I got was a jacket that barely fit anywhere, and the arms didn't fit except in length. I'm not a muscular guy, and I can just imagine the circus getting the jacket on if I was. Levi's has obviously decided that their future is with thin hipster's and not us plain old working folk. Okay, so be it."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,"For the ladies, too!",4.0,"I bought a men's jacket so I'd be able to layer, and to have a longer cut. The ladies jackets seem to be cut really short and are very fitted. I'm 145lbs 5'7"" with wide hips and a small fits pretty well, considering it's a men's cut. It has the loose fit I was aiming for  but it is pretty tight in the hips. I usually wear a size 6 bottoms, and I can't button the bottom two buttons. I don't mind it though, because I don't plan to ever wear it buttoned up. I'm very narrow in the shoulders, so the breast of the jacket and the arm holes are a little large. Again, not bothered, because it will give me room to put a Hoodie under it in cooler weather. This is straight up classic denim, so there's no stretch, but it's also not too stiff. It's just right."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,The Classic Denim Jacket,5.0,"Fifty years ago, this was the classic denim jacket for guys...as it still is today.It is a light weight to wear in all seasons...over a tee shirt on a summer night, over a sweater on a winter afternoon.Many people want their denim jacket to fit like a snug, tight shirt.  I prefer a looser fit to wear over a thick sweater.  I am 5'10"", 180 pounds.  A medium would be tight and the cuffs would be above my wrists.  I got the large size, which fits loosely over a tee shirt and the sleeves cover my wrists.I like the loose/long fit so I wash the jacket in cold water and line dry.  If I wanted to shorten the sleeves, I'm guessing that a hot water wash and a hot dryer might take an inch off the sleeves.When your jacket is new you should wear it everyday until iteventually takes on the shape of your body. In a few months it will fit like a glove."

There were some random wear marks in the jacket. Also, not a big deal. So far, I love it and I recommend it."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Size alert,1.0,"Very disappointed with the sizing on this jacket. I normally order a 2 extra large tall in jackets and shirts. This item did not have that size to select from but it did have a 3 xl so my thinking was that it would probably work.  It turned out to not even be close. The sleeves are too short and too small in diameter, the jacket is too short, the shoulders are too narrow and the jacket will not button. It's undersized in every aspect. I'm guessing that it probably would work well if a person wore a large/extra large but certainly not any larger than that. The tag in the jacket says 3 extra large, but it most assuredly is not."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,No Snake Arms Here,2.0,"I've been worn Levi's products, including the jackets in question, for about 55 years now. I'm pretty used to how their sizing runs. Until now, that is. I read some reviews before making this purchase, so I bought a size larger than I would have thought, an XXL. What I got was a jacket that barely fit anywhere, and the arms didn't fit except in length. I'm not a muscular guy, and I can just imagine the circus getting the jacket on if I was. Levi's has obviously decided that their future is with thin hipster's and not us plain old working folk. Okay, so be it."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,"For the ladies, too!",4.0,"I bought a men's jacket so I'd be able to layer, and to have a longer cut. The ladies jackets seem to be cut really short and are very fitted. I'm 145lbs 5'7"" with wide hips and a small fits pretty well, considering it's a men's cut. It has the loose fit I was aiming for  but it is pretty tight in the hips. I usually wear a size 6 bottoms, and I can't button the bottom two buttons. I don't mind it though, because I don't plan to ever wear it buttoned up. I'm very narrow in the shoulders, so the breast of the jacket and the arm holes are a little large. Again, not bothered, because it will give me room to put a Hoodie under it in cooler weather. This is straight up classic denim, so there's no stretch, but it's also not too stiff. It's just right."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,The Classic Denim Jacket,5.0,"Fifty years ago, this was the classic denim jacket for guys...as it still is today.It is a light weight to wear in all seasons...over a tee shirt on a summer night, over a sweater on a winter afternoon.Many people want their denim jacket to fit like a snug, tight shirt.  I prefer a looser fit to wear over a thick sweater.  I am 5'10"", 180 pounds.  A medium would be tight and the cuffs would be above my wrists.  I got the large size, which fits loosely over a tee shirt and the sleeves cover my wrists.I like the loose/long fit so I wash the jacket in cold water and line dry.  If I wanted to shorten the sleeves, I'm guessing that a hot water wash and a hot dryer might take an inch off the sleeves.When your jacket is new you should wear it everyday until iteventually takes on the shape of your body.

He is six foot two, and the jackets arms are long enough, and it fits him fine thru the abdomen but it is to tight in the biceps and the chest. I also ordered one for my brother who wear a medium and his fits perfectly. This jacket was on the deal of the day and is currently more than twice the price it was. Amazon refused to exchange this jacket for a bigger size. but is willing to refund the original price, but then I'll have to cough up the double the cash to get a jacket that might actually fit him. He has never ever wore and xx-large in anything. Could it be they labeled a large an x-large. We've been Amazon shoppers since Amazon started and have gotten a lot of good deals, but in the rare instance we have needed to exchange or return something we have had nothing but trouble."

Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Now this is a “Boyfriend” Style Jacket,5.0,"I was looking for an oversized jacket to wear with certain outfits - this time to wear over a hockey jersey. Most “boyfriend” style clothes made for women aren’t really that oversized so I’ve given up and this was my first attempt at ordering a men’s jacket online and hoping it’d fit just right. Luckily it did! I’m 5’8, 150lbs and I purchased a medium. It had just the right amount of bagginess I wanted and it perfected the outfit I had envisioned. Very happy!"
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,GO WITH YOUR GUT!!,5.0,"Fits perfectly - I purchased a Medium. I’m 180 lbs, 6 feet tall, regular semi athletic build. I can wear it with a hoodie or flannel underneath and it looks great. It’s supposed to be a little snug.  I only read two or three reviews that told me to “go with my gut” and hundreds of other reviews that told me to size up to a large. I’m glad I didn’t listen to the masses on this one. I think the disagreement stems from 3 issues:- People aren’t sure how these are supposed to fit: the sleeves are supposed to come down to your wrists and the bottom should rest at the top of your waist at your belt line. It should feel snug some areas, or else it loses the edgy look.- I think there are lots of muscular guys with huge biceps buying mediums or smalls, OR very large men buying larges. If you have really big biceps, or are just a large person altogether, you may need to size up. If you fall with in typical sizes, go with your typical sizes.- Some might be 100% cotton and some have 2% Elasane (spandex); I think the 2% can make a huge difference in how it fits/stretches out. The one I bought was a “stretch” which means it had that 2%. Maybe they all have this? I’m not sure.In sum, if you over 6 feet tall and over 180lb, use the sizing chart and *maybe* size up. I’m very happy with mine. Can’t stop wearing it!"
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Best Review,5.0,"If you need to know your size, go to Levi's website and look up your measurements for jackets and it'll be fairly accurate. I'm about 5'10"" 185lbs~ and I went to their website, measured my chest (about 42-43"") and my waist (about 33"") and it said to get medium, so I bought a medium and the fit is nearly perfect. If you want a baggier jacket, I recommend going up a size from what it tells you, but if you're like me and want a slimmer fitting jacket, the measurements should be pretty accurate. If you do go with the slimmer fit and you want to wear a hoodie underneath the jacket, just know that it'll be pretty snug. But for wearing with just a normal shirt, it'll be great.

It seems like this jacket would fit a person about 5'7"" and a max of 180 pounds. I'll be ordering from another producer. Lee, or maybe wrangler? If ordering this item, I'd recommend ordering 2 sizes larger than you wear.... I actually attempted to put this on. My arms felt like stuffed sausages in the sleeves, and there's no way the jacket could be closed around my 38 inch waist."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Fit and quality.,5.0,"I was ver cautious base on reviews saying “too small, too big, not quality  Levi material”. However i really wanted a camouflage tucker jacket.

Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Now this is a “Boyfriend” Style Jacket,5.0,"I was looking for an oversized jacket to wear with certain outfits - this time to wear over a hockey jersey. Most “boyfriend” style clothes made for women aren’t really that oversized so I’ve given up and this was my first attempt at ordering a men’s jacket online and hoping it’d fit just right. Luckily it did! I’m 5’8, 150lbs and I purchased a medium. It had just the right amount of bagginess I wanted and it perfected the outfit I had envisioned. Very happy!"
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,GO WITH YOUR GUT!!,5.0,"Fits perfectly - I purchased a Medium. I’m 180 lbs, 6 feet tall, regular semi athletic build. I can wear it with a hoodie or flannel underneath and it looks great. It’s supposed to be a little snug.  I only read two or three reviews that told me to “go with my gut” and hundreds of other reviews that told me to size up to a large. I’m glad I didn’t listen to the masses on this one. I think the disagreement stems from 3 issues:- People aren’t sure how these are supposed to fit: the sleeves are supposed to come down to your wrists and the bottom should rest at the top of your waist at your belt line. It should feel snug some areas, or else it loses the edgy look.- I think there are lots of muscular guys with huge biceps buying mediums or smalls, OR very large men buying larges. If you have really big biceps, or are just a large person altogether, you may need to size up. If you fall with in typical sizes, go with your typical sizes.- Some might be 100% cotton and some have 2% Elasane (spandex); I think the 2% can make a huge difference in how it fits/stretches out. The one I bought was a “stretch” which means it had that 2%. Maybe they all have this? I’m not sure.In sum, if you over 6 feet tall and over 180lb, use the sizing chart and *maybe* size up. I’m very happy with mine. Can’t stop wearing it!"
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Best Review,5.0,"If you need to know your size, go to Levi's website and look up your measurements for jackets and it'll be fairly accurate. I'm about 5'10"" 185lbs~ and I went to their website, measured my chest (about 42-43"") and my waist (about 33"") and it said to get medium, so I bought a medium and the fit is nearly perfect. If you want a baggier jacket, I recommend going up a size from what it tells you, but if you're like me and want a slimmer fitting jacket, the measurements should be pretty accurate. If you do go with the slimmer fit and you want to wear a hoodie underneath the jacket, just know that it'll be pretty snug. But for wearing with just a normal shirt, it'll be great. Now onto the actual jacket. Everything is great about it except for two small things. 1. The sleeves are just a tad bit too long for me, but it's not bad. 2. There were some random wear marks in the jacket. Also, not a big deal. So far, I love it and I recommend it."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Size alert,1.0,"Very disappointed with the sizing on this jacket. I normally order a 2 extra large tall in jackets and shirts. This item did not have that size to select from but it did have a 3 xl so my thinking was that it would probably work.  It turned out to not even be close. The sleeves are too short and too small in diameter, the jacket is too short, the shoulders are too narrow and the jacket will not button. It's undersized in every aspect. I'm guessing that it probably would work well if a person wore a large/extra large but certainly not any larger than that. The tag in the jacket says 3 extra large, but it most assuredly is not."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,No Snake Arms Here,2.0,"I've been worn Levi's products, including the jackets in question, for about 55 years now. I'm pretty used to how their sizing runs. Until now, that is. I read some reviews before making this purchase, so I bought a size larger than I would have thought, an XXL. What I got was a jacket that barely fit anywhere, and the arms didn't fit except in length. I'm not a muscular guy, and I can just imagine the circus getting the jacket on if I was. Levi's has obviously decided that their future is with thin hipster's and not us plain old working folk. Okay, so be it."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,"For the ladies, too!",4.0,"I bought a men's jacket so I'd be able to layer, and to have a longer cut. The ladies jackets seem to be cut really short and are very fitted. I'm 145lbs 5'7"" with wide hips and a small fits pretty well, considering it's a men's cut. It has the loose fit I was aiming for  but it is pretty tight in the hips. I usually wear a size 6 bottoms, and I can't button the bottom two buttons. I don't mind it though, because I don't plan to ever wear it buttoned up. I'm very narrow in the shoulders, so the breast of the jacket and the arm holes are a little large. Again, not bothered, because it will give me room to put a Hoodie under it in cooler weather. This is straight up classic denim, so there's no stretch, but it's also not too stiff. It's just right."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,The Classic Denim Jacket,5.0,"Fifty years ago, this was the classic denim jacket for guys...as it still is today.It is a light weight to wear in all seasons...over a tee shirt on a summer night, over a sweater on a winter afternoon.Many people want their denim jacket to fit like a snug, tight shirt.  I prefer a looser fit to wear over a thick sweater.  I am 5'10"", 180 pounds.  A medium would be tight and the cuffs would be above my wrists.  I got the large size, which fits loosely over a tee shirt and the sleeves cover my wrists.I like the loose/long fit so I wash the jacket in cold water and line dry.  If I wanted to shorten the sleeves, I'm guessing that a hot water wash and a hot dryer might take an inch off the sleeves.When your jacket is new you should wear it everyday until iteventually takes on the shape of your body. In a few months it will fit like a glove."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,If you have even a tiny bit of muscle consider ordering a size up,1.0,"Bought this jacket for my father who is a x-large in all shirts, jackets, and coats he has ever worn. However, this jacket was two small in the arms and thru the shoulders and chest. He is six foot two, and the jackets arms are long enough, and it fits him fine thru the abdomen but it is to tight in the biceps and the chest. I also ordered one for my brother who wear a medium and his fits perfectly. This jacket was on the deal of the day and is currently more than twice the price it was. Amazon refused to exchange this jacket for a bigger size. but is willing to refund the original price, but then I'll have to cough up the double the cash to get a jacket that might actually fit him. He has never ever wore and xx-large in anything. Could it be they labeled a large an x-large. We've been Amazon shoppers since Amazon started and have gotten a lot of good deals, but in the rare instance we have needed to exchange or return something we have had nothing but trouble."

Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,No Snake Arms Here,2.0,"I've been worn Levi's products, including the jackets in question, for about 55 years now. I'm pretty used to how their sizing runs. Until now, that is. I read some reviews before making this purchase, so I bought a size larger than I would have thought, an XXL. What I got was a jacket that barely fit anywhere, and the arms didn't fit except in length. I'm not a muscular guy, and I can just imagine the circus getting the jacket on if I was. Levi's has obviously decided that their future is with thin hipster's and not us plain old working folk. Okay, so be it."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,"For the ladies, too!",4.0,"I bought a men's jacket so I'd be able to layer, and to have a longer cut. The ladies jackets seem to be cut really short and are very fitted. I'm 145lbs 5'7"" with wide hips and a small fits pretty well, considering it's a men's cut. It has the loose fit I was aiming for  but it is pretty tight in the hips. I usually wear a size 6 bottoms, and I can't button the bottom two buttons. I don't mind it though, because I don't plan to ever wear it buttoned up. I'm very narrow in the shoulders, so the breast of the jacket and the arm holes are a little large. Again, not bothered, because it will give me room to put a Hoodie under it in cooler weather. This is straight up classic denim, so there's no stretch, but it's also not too stiff. It's just right."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,The Classic Denim Jacket,5.0,"Fifty years ago, this was the classic denim jacket for guys...as it still is today.It is a light weight to wear in all seasons...over a tee shirt on a summer night, over a sweater on a winter afternoon.Many people want their denim jacket to fit like a snug, tight shirt.  I prefer a looser fit to wear over a thick sweater.  I am 5'10"", 180 pounds.  A medium would be tight and the cuffs would be above my wrists.  I got the large size, which fits loosely over a tee shirt and the sleeves cover my wrists.I like the loose/long fit so I wash the jacket in cold water and line dry.  If I wanted to shorten the sleeves, I'm guessing that a hot water wash and a hot dryer might take an inch off the sleeves.When your jacket is new you should wear it everyday until iteventually takes on the shape of your body. In a few months it will fit like a glove."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,If you have even a tiny bit of muscle consider ordering a size up,1.0,"Bought this jacket for my father who is a x-large in all shirts, jackets, and coats he has ever worn. However, this jacket was two small in the arms and thru the shoulders and chest. He is six foot two, and the jackets arms are long enough, and it fits him fine thru the abdomen but it is to tight in the biceps and the chest. I also ordered one for my brother who wear a medium and his fits perfectly. This jacket was on the deal of the day and is currently more than twice the price it was. Amazon refused to exchange this jacket for a bigger size. but is willing to refund the original price, but then I'll have to cough up the double the cash to get a jacket that might actually fit him. He has never ever wore and xx-large in anything. Could it be they labeled a large an x-large. We've been Amazon shoppers since Amazon started and have gotten a lot of good deals, but in the rare instance we have needed to exchange or return something we have had nothing but trouble."
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Does not run true to u.s. sizes!,1.0,"This apparently runs in Bangladeshi sizes- this would be appropriate, because that's where it's made. Apparently, men in Bangladesh are quite a lot smaller then here in the united states. I ordered This in a 2xl size. The header shows it runs true to sizes- I found this wasn't so. As a 6 foot 230 pound person, I typically wear 2xl in most all clothing. This jacket came labeled a 2xl, however it was about 2 sizes too small. Making This literally a u.s. large? It seems like this jacket would fit a person about 5'7"" and a max of 180 pounds. I'll be ordering from another producer. Lee, or maybe wrangler? If ordering this item, I'd recommend ordering 2 sizes larger than you wear.... I actually attempted to put this on.

Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Fit and quality.,5.0,"I was ver cautious base on reviews saying “too small, too big, not quality  Levi material”. However i really wanted a camouflage tucker jacket.

Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Now this is a “Boyfriend” Style Jacket,5.0,"I was looking for an oversized jacket to wear with certain outfits - this time to wear over a hockey jersey. Most “boyfriend” style clothes made for women aren’t really that oversized so I’ve given up and this was my first attempt at ordering a men’s jacket online and hoping it’d fit just right. Luckily it did! I’m 5’8, 150lbs and I purchased a medium. It had just the right amount of bagginess I wanted and it perfected the outfit I had envisioned. Very happy!"
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,GO WITH YOUR GUT!!,5.0,"Fits perfectly - I purchased a Medium. I’m 180 lbs, 6 feet tall, regular semi athletic build. I can wear it with a hoodie or flannel underneath and it looks great. It’s supposed to be a little snug.  I only read two or three reviews that told me to “go with my gut” and hundreds of other reviews that told me to size up to a large. I’m glad I didn’t listen to the masses on this one. I think the disagreement stems from 3 issues:- People aren’t sure how these are supposed to fit: the sleeves are supposed to come down to your wrists and the bottom should rest at the top of your waist at your belt line. It should feel snug some areas, or else it loses the edgy look.- I think there are lots of muscular guys with huge biceps buying mediums or smalls, OR very large men buying larges. If you have really big biceps, or are just a large person altogether, you may need to size up. If you fall with in typical sizes, go with your typical sizes.- Some might be 100% cotton and some have 2% Elasane (spandex); I think the 2% can make a huge difference in how it fits/stretches out. The one I bought was a “stretch” which means it had that 2%. Maybe they all have this? I’m not sure.In sum, if you over 6 feet tall and over 180lb, use the sizing chart and *maybe* size up. I’m very happy with mine. Can’t stop wearing it!"
Levi's Men's Trucker Jacket,Best Review,5.0,"If you need to know your size, go to Levi's website and look up your measurements for jackets and it'll be fairly accurate. I'm about 5'10"" 185lbs~ and I went to their website, measured my chest (about 42-43"") and my waist (about 33"") and it said to get medium, so I bought a medium and the fit is nearly perfect. If you want a baggier jacket, I recommend going up a size from what it tells you, but if you're like me and want a slimmer fitting jacket, the measurements should be pretty accurate. If you do go with the slimmer fit and you want to wear a hoodie underneath the jacket, just know that it'll be pretty snug. But for wearing with just a normal shirt, it'll be great. Now onto the actual jacket. Everything is great about it except for two small things. 1. The sleeves are just a tad bit too long for me, but it's not bad. 2. There were some random wear marks in the jacket. Also, not a big deal. So far, I love it and I recommend it."

The well sealed seams, quality zippers and powder skirt inside around the waist all work extremely well to keep the wind and snow out. It is also soft, flexible and light weight which makes it very comfortable for all day skiing and chair lift riding. The ""Life Pocket"" really did seam to preserve my phone battery life on cold days while running a resort app with GPS to track my ski stats. Best insulated jacket I have ever skied with in 45 years of gear testing. Bonus: My partner says it looks very good also. Should have bought it sooner."

This jacket is described as trim cut vs. the relaxed/baggy fit of some of its siblings.  At 5’ 11”/220lbs, I typically have to go a size up, but not here as the XL fit me perfectly.  Not too baggy or bulky despite the Primaloft insulation. I wear a 17.5 34/35 in men’s shirts and the jacket and sleeve length were also spot on.Hard to beat the price either!"

It is so incredibly comfortable and well-balanced. It just feels good to wear and kept me comfortable whether I was in 25 degree snow-blown craziness or a 60 degree mild morning. I love all of the pockets. The zippers function well. There are ventilation options on this thing that I haven't gotten to use yet, but I'm sure they will prove to be inline with the quality I've experienced so far.If you're traveling and are looking to take just one jacket to keep you warm and dry in variety of climates, this is the one. I'm very happy with my purchase."
Helly-Hansen 65551 Men's Alpha 3.0 Jacket,"Quality built, very warm/water proof performance ski jacket.",5.0,"This jacket checks all the boxes for a high performance insulated ski jacket. It is now my go to jacket for in bounds/resort skiing. I have now tested it in wet snow and Very cold (-8 F) conditions and was completely dry and comfortable. The well sealed seams, quality zippers and powder skirt inside around the waist all work extremely well to keep the wind and snow out. It is also soft, flexible and light weight which makes it very comfortable for all day skiing and chair lift riding. The ""Life Pocket"" really did seam to preserve my phone battery life on cold days while running a resort app with GPS to track my ski stats. Best insulated jacket I have ever skied with in 45 years of gear testing. Bonus: My partner says it looks very good also. Should have bought it sooner."

The entire turn-around was just a few days.The coat itself is great. I'm 6'1, 200lbs with an athletic build and the Large fits great. The forearms are a little snug, but still fit a mid layer sweater just fine. Will update again after using on the mountain this weekend. Really pleased so far.I would have given 5 stars, but (per the pictures) the stitching under the chest pockets was loose when the jacket arrived.Really doesn't bode well for the longevity of the jacket."

Helly-Hansen 65551 Men's Alpha 3.0 Jacket,Runs small,5.0,"I returned the size medium yellow Alpha 3 and bought a blue large Alpha 3. I am 5'8"" and weigh 172 lbs. I tend to keep my ski gear forever and a day and I don't see why the HH Alpha 3 won't last that long. The jacket is warm when it's cold outside and not overly warm during spring skiing."
Helly-Hansen 65551 Men's Alpha 3.0 Jacket,Amazing jacket!,5.0,"Excellent jacket! This jacket is as good as it gets. Warm, comfortable, and allows for excellent movement. Don’t get me wrong, it is a bit pricey but it’s a great jacket and made extremely well."

Helly-Hansen 65551 Men's Alpha 3.0 Jacket,Amazing Jacket,5.0,"I finally did it and bought a nice jacket for myself. It worked great and isn't bulky. I skied in a snow storm that was below zero, and it worked great. I stayed warm the whole time. Then also on the nicer days it breaths nicely. Highly recommend this jacket."
Helly-Hansen 65551 Men's Alpha 3.0 Jacket,This is my absolute favorite jacket ever!!!,5.0,"I bought this jacket for a trip to Wisconsin, and had read both good and bad reviews... but once I received it, I knew I'd made a good decision. It is so incredibly comfortable and well-balanced. It just feels good to wear and kept me comfortable whether I was in 25 degree snow-blown craziness or a 60 degree mild morning. I love all of the pockets. The zippers function well. There are ventilation options on this thing that I haven't gotten to use yet, but I'm sure they will prove to be inline with the quality I've experienced so far.If you're traveling and are looking to take just one jacket to keep you warm and dry in variety of climates, this is the one. I'm very happy with my purchase."
Helly-Hansen 65551 Men's Alpha 3.0 Jacket,"Quality built, very warm/water proof performance ski jacket.",5.0,"This jacket checks all the boxes for a high performance insulated ski jacket. It is now my go to jacket for in bounds/resort skiing. I have now tested it in wet snow and Very cold (-8 F) conditions and was completely dry and comfortable. The well sealed seams, quality zippers and powder skirt inside around the waist all work extremely well to keep the wind and snow out. It is also soft, flexible and light weight which makes it very comfortable for all day skiing and chair lift riding. The ""Life Pocket"" really did seam to preserve my phone battery life on cold days while running a resort app with GPS to track my ski stats. Best insulated jacket I have ever skied with in 45 years of gear testing. Bonus: My partner says it looks very good also. Should have bought it sooner."

The entire turn-around was just a few days.The coat itself is great. I'm 6'1, 200lbs with an athletic build and the Large fits great. The forearms are a little snug, but still fit a mid layer sweater just fine. Will update again after using on the mountain this weekend. Really pleased so far.I would have given 5 stars, but (per the pictures) the stitching under the chest pockets was loose when the jacket arrived.Really doesn't bode well for the longevity of the jacket."

Helly-Hansen 65551 Men's Alpha 3.0 Jacket,Amazing jacket!,5.0,"Excellent jacket! This jacket is as good as it gets. Warm, comfortable, and allows for excellent movement. Don’t get me wrong, it is a bit pricey but it’s a great jacket and made extremely well."
Helly-Hansen 65551 Men's Alpha 3.0 Jacket,"Good everyday, good Ski, but thin",4.0,"Be prepared to layer under this coat.  My old HH was 10 times warmer, so I was a little letdown."
Helly-Hansen 65551 Men's Alpha 3.0 Jacket,I absolutely love the hood,5.0,"I was skeptical giving that I live in Minnesota, but this is a warm jacket. I absolutely love the hood, multiple zipper utility pockets, and the style. My wife really likes the look."
Helly-Hansen 65551 Men's Alpha 3.0 Jacket,Amazing Jacket,5.0,"I finally did it and bought a nice jacket for myself. It worked great and isn't bulky. I skied in a snow storm that was below zero, and it worked great. I stayed warm the whole time. Then also on the nicer days it breaths nicely. Highly recommend this jacket."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,This jacket is not waterproof,1.0,"I bought this jacket because it was advertised as waterproof. I specifically did not buy one that was ""water resistant."" I wore this for a hike for the first time today and as you can see from the picture, it is not waterproof.I came back soaked from the hike. I wish I could give this product a zero because it does not work as advertised. DO NOT BUY this if you will be in the rain for any prolonged period of time."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,but its basically been like this since the first time I wore it in ...,1.0,"I've had this jacket for a while, a bit over a year now, and this is definitely not a rain jacket. The jacket is waterproof only for very short periods of time. If I wear it in heavy rain walking from my car into my office building, by the time I get to my desk, a less than 2 minute trip total, water is already starting so soak through and the inside of the back of the jacket is starting to get damp. Unfortunately I discovered this well after the return window, but its basically been like this since the first time I wore it in rain, about 2 months after purchase.Now, it never gets particularly soaked, but some water definitely permeates the jacket, and does so pretty quickly. Just to make sure it wasn't sweat and body humidity accumulating inside the jacket, I hung it on a chair, sprayed it down with a hose in the middle of the back, where there are no seams. After spraying I checked the inside was still dry, and let it sit for about 5 minutes. Coming back, it was damp inside. Putting the jacket on, it was damp enough I could feel the wetness on my back through the wicking polo shirt I had on almost immediately, but  not so wet that my shirt looked wet when I took it off.Despite being somewhat water permeable, it isn't very breathable.Wearing this jacket in pre-storm weather on a warm summer day will very quickly result in a lot of sweat accumulating inside the jacket.This  jacket is really more of a ""water resistant, non breathable windbreaker"" than anything else. Not impressed. I prefer my windbreakers to be much more breathable than this. I prefer my raincoats to be waterproof enough to stand in the rain for a half hour without getting wet. This jacket doesn't fit either.Perhaps I got a bad one, as there are some reviews like mine, and others claiming it is waterproof. Maybe some waterproof coating gets sprayed on at the factory and they forgot mine. Whatever the case, this isn't really a raincoat."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,"Excellent Fit, Great Price",4.0,"This jacket does exactly what it's supposed to do: packs small and keeps me dry when I need it. The fit is great (runs a bit big, so I ordered one size down), and the price can't be beat. It really inspired me to vote Donald Trump out in November."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Unlined sleeves: it does matter,3.0,"This came quick, fits as expected and repels water just as advertised.And while I knew this ahead of time, I had no idea why this little fact was important until I wore it a few times: the sleeves aren't lined.I live on the central Oregon coast. It is mostly wet all the time. Thus, you tend to make your decisions when you head outside based on whether you care you are getting wet or not. If you care, you put on your big, ol' coat and head out. If you don't, then just head out sans coat and get wet.As I get older, the less I enjoy the ""I'll just get wet"" option. So I got this thinking it would serve well in the scenarios where I ordinarily would just suffer getting wet. This was small and light and would be a quick way to stay dry without overheating.Except that the sleeves aren't lined.So, if it is a fairly nice day, but raining as usual, and you toss this over your short sleeves and head to the garage, by the time you get there, it will be stuck to your arms like a wetsuit. This isn't because of the outside rain. This is due to the trapped moisture *inside* the coat. Thus, the second the moisture impervious material comes in contact with your arms, it sticks to them. Which is not a nice feeling. In fact, the feeling is pretty much exactly ""I can't wait to get this thing off me.""So, it is useless on days where the temperature says short sleeves but the clouds say rain.I will keep it as in colder temperatures, it is easier than dealing with a heavy coat for quick outdoor adventures.But it isn't functional in the ways I had hoped."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Should be called a windbreaker NOT a rain jacket,1.0,"We just received this item last week and my husband had a chance to use it this past weekend when we were in the mountains. It rained off and on quite a bit and during the first time it rained, which was NOT a downpour just regular light rain, it soaked through the jacket material and onto his shirt leaving wet spots. So, Columbia's name for this jacket is definitely a bit of a stretch."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,All-in-all a good rain jacket to use for years to come,5.0,"Bought this rain jacket for my teenage son. Part of me wanted the rain jacket I bought for him to have more substance to it, but that's not the point of a spring rain jacket. This has no soft lining because it's not supposed to. We live in Virginia where you typically (not this year!) have only a handful of days that are spring warm/hot but significantly raining. So even your lightweight winter hooded jacket is too warm for the weather but a non-rain resistant spring jacket won't do either. We hate having to carry umbrellas, so this lightweight, hooded rain jacket does the trick. I bought Columbia thinking that he can own it for years to come since he's done with all of his major growth spurts & our area typically doesn't have enough of these days to justify buying a new one every year for a growing kid. It's also very squishable/packable, so it's the kind of thing that I would recommend he throw into every duffle/suitcase he packs for trips as a ""just in case"" kind of thing that takes up so little room & adds so little weight to your luggage that you're grateful if you need it & you don't really mind that you brought it even if you didn't end up needing it."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Sauna Jacket,1.0,"While this jacket has some mesh lining, it is only on the front portions near the zipper. The rest of the inside is open to the inside liner that acts as more of a sauna than anything else. The inside of the sleeves stick to my arms at the first sign of perspiration and that is with wearing the jacket in cool temperatures (in the 40 to 50 degree range Fahrenheit) . The jacket uses Velcro patches to secure away the rain hood and uses the same means to secure an inside pouch that it touts one is able to use to store the jacket in on itself. I am weary of using the Velcro patches as the ones around the hood already show some strain in the stitches used to secure them. This is the second jacket that I ordered that used the Velcro means to secure the hood - I returned the first as the Velcro patches on it already had the stitching pulling out completely."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Fits great and keeps you dry!,5.0,"First off gotta say I love this. Very happy I got it! There’s some things I wish were different and I’ll get into that but overall I think it’s a solid buy.Size: So I’m 6’4” and about 340lbs. The sizing was confusing when buying so I kept looking on other reviews etc to guess. Almost bought a 3Xl but I’m glad I went with the 4Xl instead. A little big but not unflattering. In fact it felt better and more breathable that way. So if you’re a big guy there’s big sizes for you!Design pros: Bought for deep sea fishing but honestly, I think I’d rock this even as a rainy day jacket! It’s got a nice style! Cons: lack of lining inside the sleeves can make it feel a bit clammy if you have nothing under and it’s resting just on your skin. Also, the straps at the wrists only help make it smaller not bigger as I was assuming so it’s not something you can role up your sleeves with.Pockets are a bit underwhelming as they’re made of a very flimsy feeling mesh(may not actually be flimsy) but I did not feel safe having anything important in my pockets.All that being said? I would still really Recommend this especially for bigger guys as our options are limited!"
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,A solid rain/wind jacket,4.0,Jackets either work or they don't.  I needed a rain jacket and picked this one because it looked like the hood would cover my head well.  It didn't disappoint and does a good job in rain.  What I didn't see coming was being able to swing a golf club with it on.  It's been cold and windy in the bay area lately so a hoodie is required.  I don't usually wear a hoodie type jacket when I golf as they're usually uncomfortable and make it hard to swing.  This one worked really well.  A good buy.
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Toasty jacket that punches way above its weight class.,4.0,"For the price, you aren't likely to find a better packable rain jacket than this. From the snazzy color scheme and design to the light weight, to the stowable hood and roomy pockets, this jacket punches way above its weight class. The jacket packs down easily into a pouch about the size of a softball, and can therefore be taken just about anywhere without being cumbersome. Once you've got it unpacked, you'll be able to cinch the wrists to your comfort level, and with the zipper zipped and hood up, you'll stay dry as well as toasty. That leads me to one of the jacket's only issues. Due to the water-resistant nature of the materials, the jacket doesn't breathe very well. A couple of underarm vents would have made a huge difference in the comfort level of this jacket. However, as long as you're not trying to stay dry in the tropics, it really isn't enough to be a deal breaker. No, this jacket isn't going to stop you getting wet in a hurricane, but it's great for mild to moderate rain, and at less than $40.00, it's well worth having."

Just to make sure it wasn't sweat and body humidity accumulating inside the jacket, I hung it on a chair, sprayed it down with a hose in the middle of the back, where there are no seams. After spraying I checked the inside was still dry, and let it sit for about 5 minutes. Coming back, it was damp inside. Putting the jacket on, it was damp enough I could feel the wetness on my back through the wicking polo shirt I had on almost immediately, but  not so wet that my shirt looked wet when I took it off.Despite being somewhat water permeable, it isn't very breathable.Wearing this jacket in pre-storm weather on a warm summer day will very quickly result in a lot of sweat accumulating inside the jacket.This  jacket is really more of a ""water resistant, non breathable windbreaker"" than anything else. Not impressed. I prefer my windbreakers to be much more breathable than this. I prefer my raincoats to be waterproof enough to stand in the rain for a half hour without getting wet. This jacket doesn't fit either.Perhaps I got a bad one, as there are some reviews like mine, and others claiming it is waterproof. Maybe some waterproof coating gets sprayed on at the factory and they forgot mine. Whatever the case, this isn't really a raincoat."

Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Unlined sleeves: it does matter,3.0,"This came quick, fits as expected and repels water just as advertised.And while I knew this ahead of time, I had no idea why this little fact was important until I wore it a few times: the sleeves aren't lined.I live on the central Oregon coast. It is mostly wet all the time. Thus, you tend to make your decisions when you head outside based on whether you care you are getting wet or not. If you care, you put on your big, ol' coat and head out. If you don't, then just head out sans coat and get wet.As I get older, the less I enjoy the ""I'll just get wet"" option. So I got this thinking it would serve well in the scenarios where I ordinarily would just suffer getting wet. This was small and light and would be a quick way to stay dry without overheating.Except that the sleeves aren't lined.So, if it is a fairly nice day, but raining as usual, and you toss this over your short sleeves and head to the garage, by the time you get there, it will be stuck to your arms like a wetsuit. This isn't because of the outside rain. This is due to the trapped moisture *inside* the coat. Thus, the second the moisture impervious material comes in contact with your arms, it sticks to them. Which is not a nice feeling. In fact, the feeling is pretty much exactly ""I can't wait to get this thing off me.""So, it is useless on days where the temperature says short sleeves but the clouds say rain.I will keep it as in colder temperatures, it is easier than dealing with a heavy coat for quick outdoor adventures.But it isn't functional in the ways I had hoped."

Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,All-in-all a good rain jacket to use for years to come,5.0,"Bought this rain jacket for my teenage son. Part of me wanted the rain jacket I bought for him to have more substance to it, but that's not the point of a spring rain jacket. This has no soft lining because it's not supposed to. We live in Virginia where you typically (not this year!) have only a handful of days that are spring warm/hot but significantly raining. So even your lightweight winter hooded jacket is too warm for the weather but a non-rain resistant spring jacket won't do either. We hate having to carry umbrellas, so this lightweight, hooded rain jacket does the trick. I bought Columbia thinking that he can own it for years to come since he's done with all of his major growth spurts & our area typically doesn't have enough of these days to justify buying a new one every year for a growing kid. It's also very squishable/packable, so it's the kind of thing that I would recommend he throw into every duffle/suitcase he packs for trips as a ""just in case"" kind of thing that takes up so little room & adds so little weight to your luggage that you're grateful if you need it & you don't really mind that you brought it even if you didn't end up needing it."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Sauna Jacket,1.0,"While this jacket has some mesh lining, it is only on the front portions near the zipper.

The inside of the sleeves stick to my arms at the first sign of perspiration and that is with wearing the jacket in cool temperatures (in the 40 to 50 degree range Fahrenheit) . The jacket uses Velcro patches to secure away the rain hood and uses the same means to secure an inside pouch that it touts one is able to use to store the jacket in on itself. I am weary of using the Velcro patches as the ones around the hood already show some strain in the stitches used to secure them. This is the second jacket that I ordered that used the Velcro means to secure the hood - I returned the first as the Velcro patches on it already had the stitching pulling out completely."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Fits great and keeps you dry!,5.0,"First off gotta say I love this. Very happy I got it! There’s some things I wish were different and I’ll get into that but overall I think it’s a solid buy.Size: So I’m 6’4” and about 340lbs. The sizing was confusing when buying so I kept looking on other reviews etc to guess. Almost bought a 3Xl but I’m glad I went with the 4Xl instead. A little big but not unflattering. In fact it felt better and more breathable that way. So if you’re a big guy there’s big sizes for you!Design pros: Bought for deep sea fishing but honestly, I think I’d rock this even as a rainy day jacket! It’s got a nice style! Cons: lack of lining inside the sleeves can make it feel a bit clammy if you have nothing under and it’s resting just on your skin. Also, the straps at the wrists only help make it smaller not bigger as I was assuming so it’s not something you can role up your sleeves with.Pockets are a bit underwhelming as they’re made of a very flimsy feeling mesh(may not actually be flimsy) but I did not feel safe having anything important in my pockets.All that being said? I would still really Recommend this especially for bigger guys as our options are limited!"
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,A solid rain/wind jacket,4.0,Jackets either work or they don't.  I needed a rain jacket and picked this one because it looked like the hood would cover my head well.  It didn't disappoint and does a good job in rain.  What I didn't see coming was being able to swing a golf club with it on.  It's been cold and windy in the bay area lately so a hoodie is required.  I don't usually wear a hoodie type jacket when I golf as they're usually uncomfortable and make it hard to swing.  This one worked really well.  A good buy.
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Toasty jacket that punches way above its weight class.,4.0,"For the price, you aren't likely to find a better packable rain jacket than this. From the snazzy color scheme and design to the light weight, to the stowable hood and roomy pockets, this jacket punches way above its weight class. The jacket packs down easily into a pouch about the size of a softball, and can therefore be taken just about anywhere without being cumbersome. Once you've got it unpacked, you'll be able to cinch the wrists to your comfort level, and with the zipper zipped and hood up, you'll stay dry as well as toasty. That leads me to one of the jacket's only issues. Due to the water-resistant nature of the materials, the jacket doesn't breathe very well. A couple of underarm vents would have made a huge difference in the comfort level of this jacket. However, as long as you're not trying to stay dry in the tropics, it really isn't enough to be a deal breaker. No, this jacket isn't going to stop you getting wet in a hurricane, but it's great for mild to moderate rain, and at less than $40.00, it's well worth having."

Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,All-in-all a good rain jacket to use for years to come,5.0,"Bought this rain jacket for my teenage son. Part of me wanted the rain jacket I bought for him to have more substance to it, but that's not the point of a spring rain jacket. This has no soft lining because it's not supposed to. We live in Virginia where you typically (not this year!) have only a handful of days that are spring warm/hot but significantly raining. So even your lightweight winter hooded jacket is too warm for the weather but a non-rain resistant spring jacket won't do either. We hate having to carry umbrellas, so this lightweight, hooded rain jacket does the trick. I bought Columbia thinking that he can own it for years to come since he's done with all of his major growth spurts & our area typically doesn't have enough of these days to justify buying a new one every year for a growing kid. It's also very squishable/packable, so it's the kind of thing that I would recommend he throw into every duffle/suitcase he packs for trips as a ""just in case"" kind of thing that takes up so little room & adds so little weight to your luggage that you're grateful if you need it & you don't really mind that you brought it even if you didn't end up needing it."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Sauna Jacket,1.0,"While this jacket has some mesh lining, it is only on the front portions near the zipper. The rest of the inside is open to the inside liner that acts as more of a sauna than anything else. The inside of the sleeves stick to my arms at the first sign of perspiration and that is with wearing the jacket in cool temperatures (in the 40 to 50 degree range Fahrenheit) . The jacket uses Velcro patches to secure away the rain hood and uses the same means to secure an inside pouch that it touts one is able to use to store the jacket in on itself. I am weary of using the Velcro patches as the ones around the hood already show some strain in the stitches used to secure them. This is the second jacket that I ordered that used the Velcro means to secure the hood - I returned the first as the Velcro patches on it already had the stitching pulling out completely."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Fits great and keeps you dry!,5.0,"First off gotta say I love this. Very happy I got it! There’s some things I wish were different and I’ll get into that but overall I think it’s a solid buy.Size: So I’m 6’4” and about 340lbs. The sizing was confusing when buying so I kept looking on other reviews etc to guess. Almost bought a 3Xl but I’m glad I went with the 4Xl instead. A little big but not unflattering. In fact it felt better and more breathable that way. So if you’re a big guy there’s big sizes for you!Design pros: Bought for deep sea fishing but honestly, I think I’d rock this even as a rainy day jacket! It’s got a nice style! Cons: lack of lining inside the sleeves can make it feel a bit clammy if you have nothing under and it’s resting just on your skin. Also, the straps at the wrists only help make it smaller not bigger as I was assuming so it’s not something you can role up your sleeves with.Pockets are a bit underwhelming as they’re made of a very flimsy feeling mesh(may not actually be flimsy) but I did not feel safe having anything important in my pockets.All that being said? I would still really Recommend this especially for bigger guys as our options are limited!"
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,A solid rain/wind jacket,4.0,Jackets either work or they don't.  I needed a rain jacket and picked this one because it looked like the hood would cover my head well.  It didn't disappoint and does a good job in rain.  What I didn't see coming was being able to swing a golf club with it on.  It's been cold and windy in the bay area lately so a hoodie is required.  I don't usually wear a hoodie type jacket when I golf as they're usually uncomfortable and make it hard to swing.  This one worked really well.  A good buy.
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Toasty jacket that punches way above its weight class.,4.0,"For the price, you aren't likely to find a better packable rain jacket than this. From the snazzy color scheme and design to the light weight, to the stowable hood and roomy pockets, this jacket punches way above its weight class. The jacket packs down easily into a pouch about the size of a softball, and can therefore be taken just about anywhere without being cumbersome. Once you've got it unpacked, you'll be able to cinch the wrists to your comfort level, and with the zipper zipped and hood up, you'll stay dry as well as toasty. That leads me to one of the jacket's only issues. Due to the water-resistant nature of the materials, the jacket doesn't breathe very well. A couple of underarm vents would have made a huge difference in the comfort level of this jacket. However, as long as you're not trying to stay dry in the tropics, it really isn't enough to be a deal breaker. No, this jacket isn't going to stop you getting wet in a hurricane, but it's great for mild to moderate rain, and at less than $40.00, it's well worth having."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,This jacket is not waterproof,1.0,"I bought this jacket because it was advertised as waterproof. I specifically did not buy one that was ""water resistant."" I wore this for a hike for the first time today and as you can see from the picture, it is not waterproof.I came back soaked from the hike. I wish I could give this product a zero because it does not work as advertised. DO NOT BUY this if you will be in the rain for any prolonged period of time."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,but its basically been like this since the first time I wore it in ...,1.0,"I've had this jacket for a while, a bit over a year now, and this is definitely not a rain jacket. The jacket is waterproof only for very short periods of time. If I wear it in heavy rain walking from my car into my office building, by the time I get to my desk, a less than 2 minute trip total, water is already starting so soak through and the inside of the back of the jacket is starting to get damp. Unfortunately I discovered this well after the return window, but its basically been like this since the first time I wore it in rain, about 2 months after purchase.Now, it never gets particularly soaked, but some water definitely permeates the jacket, and does so pretty quickly. Just to make sure it wasn't sweat and body humidity accumulating inside the jacket, I hung it on a chair, sprayed it down with a hose in the middle of the back, where there are no seams. After spraying I checked the inside was still dry, and let it sit for about 5 minutes. Coming back, it was damp inside. Putting the jacket on, it was damp enough I could feel the wetness on my back through the wicking polo shirt I had on almost immediately, but  not so wet that my shirt looked wet when I took it off.Despite being somewhat water permeable, it isn't very breathable.Wearing this jacket in pre-storm weather on a warm summer day will very quickly result in a lot of sweat accumulating inside the jacket.This  jacket is really more of a ""water resistant, non breathable windbreaker"" than anything else. Not impressed. I prefer my windbreakers to be much more breathable than this. I prefer my raincoats to be waterproof enough to stand in the rain for a half hour without getting wet. This jacket doesn't fit either.Perhaps I got a bad one, as there are some reviews like mine, and others claiming it is waterproof. Maybe some waterproof coating gets sprayed on at the factory and they forgot mine. Whatever the case, this isn't really a raincoat."

Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Sauna Jacket,1.0,"While this jacket has some mesh lining, it is only on the front portions near the zipper. The rest of the inside is open to the inside liner that acts as more of a sauna than anything else. The inside of the sleeves stick to my arms at the first sign of perspiration and that is with wearing the jacket in cool temperatures (in the 40 to 50 degree range Fahrenheit) . The jacket uses Velcro patches to secure away the rain hood and uses the same means to secure an inside pouch that it touts one is able to use to store the jacket in on itself. I am weary of using the Velcro patches as the ones around the hood already show some strain in the stitches used to secure them. This is the second jacket that I ordered that used the Velcro means to secure the hood - I returned the first as the Velcro patches on it already had the stitching pulling out completely."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Fits great and keeps you dry!,5.0,"First off gotta say I love this. Very happy I got it! There’s some things I wish were different and I’ll get into that but overall I think it’s a solid buy.Size: So I’m 6’4” and about 340lbs. The sizing was confusing when buying so I kept looking on other reviews etc to guess. Almost bought a 3Xl but I’m glad I went with the 4Xl instead. A little big but not unflattering. In fact it felt better and more breathable that way. So if you’re a big guy there’s big sizes for you!Design pros: Bought for deep sea fishing but honestly, I think I’d rock this even as a rainy day jacket! It’s got a nice style! Cons: lack of lining inside the sleeves can make it feel a bit clammy if you have nothing under and it’s resting just on your skin. Also, the straps at the wrists only help make it smaller not bigger as I was assuming so it’s not something you can role up your sleeves with.Pockets are a bit underwhelming as they’re made of a very flimsy feeling mesh(may not actually be flimsy) but I did not feel safe having anything important in my pockets.All that being said? I would still really Recommend this especially for bigger guys as our options are limited!"
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,A solid rain/wind jacket,4.0,Jackets either work or they don't.  I needed a rain jacket and picked this one because it looked like the hood would cover my head well.  It didn't disappoint and does a good job in rain.  What I didn't see coming was being able to swing a golf club with it on.  It's been cold and windy in the bay area lately so a hoodie is required.  I don't usually wear a hoodie type jacket when I golf as they're usually uncomfortable and make it hard to swing.  This one worked really well.  A good buy.
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Toasty jacket that punches way above its weight class.,4.0,"For the price, you aren't likely to find a better packable rain jacket than this. From the snazzy color scheme and design to the light weight, to the stowable hood and roomy pockets, this jacket punches way above its weight class. The jacket packs down easily into a pouch about the size of a softball, and can therefore be taken just about anywhere without being cumbersome. Once you've got it unpacked, you'll be able to cinch the wrists to your comfort level, and with the zipper zipped and hood up, you'll stay dry as well as toasty. That leads me to one of the jacket's only issues. Due to the water-resistant nature of the materials, the jacket doesn't breathe very well. A couple of underarm vents would have made a huge difference in the comfort level of this jacket. However, as long as you're not trying to stay dry in the tropics, it really isn't enough to be a deal breaker. No, this jacket isn't going to stop you getting wet in a hurricane, but it's great for mild to moderate rain, and at less than $40.00, it's well worth having."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,This jacket is not waterproof,1.0,"I bought this jacket because it was advertised as waterproof. I specifically did not buy one that was ""water resistant."" I wore this for a hike for the first time today and as you can see from the picture, it is not waterproof.I came back soaked from the hike. I wish I could give this product a zero because it does not work as advertised. DO NOT BUY this if you will be in the rain for any prolonged period of time."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,but its basically been like this since the first time I wore it in ...,1.0,"I've had this jacket for a while, a bit over a year now, and this is definitely not a rain jacket. The jacket is waterproof only for very short periods of time. If I wear it in heavy rain walking from my car into my office building, by the time I get to my desk, a less than 2 minute trip total, water is already starting so soak through and the inside of the back of the jacket is starting to get damp. Unfortunately I discovered this well after the return window, but its basically been like this since the first time I wore it in rain, about 2 months after purchase.Now, it never gets particularly soaked, but some water definitely permeates the jacket, and does so pretty quickly. Just to make sure it wasn't sweat and body humidity accumulating inside the jacket, I hung it on a chair, sprayed it down with a hose in the middle of the back, where there are no seams. After spraying I checked the inside was still dry, and let it sit for about 5 minutes. Coming back, it was damp inside. Putting the jacket on, it was damp enough I could feel the wetness on my back through the wicking polo shirt I had on almost immediately, but  not so wet that my shirt looked wet when I took it off.Despite being somewhat water permeable, it isn't very breathable.Wearing this jacket in pre-storm weather on a warm summer day will very quickly result in a lot of sweat accumulating inside the jacket.This  jacket is really more of a ""water resistant, non breathable windbreaker"" than anything else. Not impressed. I prefer my windbreakers to be much more breathable than this. I prefer my raincoats to be waterproof enough to stand in the rain for a half hour without getting wet. This jacket doesn't fit either.Perhaps I got a bad one, as there are some reviews like mine, and others claiming it is waterproof. Maybe some waterproof coating gets sprayed on at the factory and they forgot mine. Whatever the case, this isn't really a raincoat."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,"Excellent Fit, Great Price",4.0,"This jacket does exactly what it's supposed to do: packs small and keeps me dry when I need it. The fit is great (runs a bit big, so I ordered one size down), and the price can't be beat. It really inspired me to vote Donald Trump out in November."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Unlined sleeves: it does matter,3.0,"This came quick, fits as expected and repels water just as advertised.And while I knew this ahead of time, I had no idea why this little fact was important until I wore it a few times: the sleeves aren't lined.I live on the central Oregon coast. It is mostly wet all the time. Thus, you tend to make your decisions when you head outside based on whether you care you are getting wet or not. If you care, you put on your big, ol' coat and head out. If you don't, then just head out sans coat and get wet.As I get older, the less I enjoy the ""I'll just get wet"" option. So I got this thinking it would serve well in the scenarios where I ordinarily would just suffer getting wet. This was small and light and would be a quick way to stay dry without overheating.Except that the sleeves aren't lined.So, if it is a fairly nice day, but raining as usual, and you toss this over your short sleeves and head to the garage, by the time you get there, it will be stuck to your arms like a wetsuit. This isn't because of the outside rain. This is due to the trapped moisture *inside* the coat. Thus, the second the moisture impervious material comes in contact with your arms, it sticks to them. Which is not a nice feeling. In fact, the feeling is pretty much exactly ""I can't wait to get this thing off me.""So, it is useless on days where the temperature says short sleeves but the clouds say rain.I will keep it as in colder temperatures, it is easier than dealing with a heavy coat for quick outdoor adventures.But it isn't functional in the ways I had hoped."

It rained off and on quite a bit and during the first time it rained, which was NOT a downpour just regular light rain, it soaked through the jacket material and onto his shirt leaving wet spots. So, Columbia's name for this jacket is definitely a bit of a stretch."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,All-in-all a good rain jacket to use for years to come,5.0,"Bought this rain jacket for my teenage son. Part of me wanted the rain jacket I bought for him to have more substance to it, but that's not the point of a spring rain jacket. This has no soft lining because it's not supposed to. We live in Virginia where you typically (not this year!) have only a handful of days that are spring warm/hot but significantly raining. So even your lightweight winter hooded jacket is too warm for the weather but a non-rain resistant spring jacket won't do either. We hate having to carry umbrellas, so this lightweight, hooded rain jacket does the trick.

I needed a rain jacket and picked this one because it looked like the hood would cover my head well.  It didn't disappoint and does a good job in rain.  What I didn't see coming was being able to swing a golf club with it on.  It's been cold and windy in the bay area lately so a hoodie is required.  I don't usually wear a hoodie type jacket when I golf as they're usually uncomfortable and make it hard to swing.  This one worked really well.  A good buy.
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Toasty jacket that punches way above its weight class.,4.0,"For the price, you aren't likely to find a better packable rain jacket than this. From the snazzy color scheme and design to the light weight, to the stowable hood and roomy pockets, this jacket punches way above its weight class. The jacket packs down easily into a pouch about the size of a softball, and can therefore be taken just about anywhere without being cumbersome. Once you've got it unpacked, you'll be able to cinch the wrists to your comfort level, and with the zipper zipped and hood up, you'll stay dry as well as toasty. That leads me to one of the jacket's only issues. Due to the water-resistant nature of the materials, the jacket doesn't breathe very well. A couple of underarm vents would have made a huge difference in the comfort level of this jacket. However, as long as you're not trying to stay dry in the tropics, it really isn't enough to be a deal breaker. No, this jacket isn't going to stop you getting wet in a hurricane, but it's great for mild to moderate rain, and at less than $40.00, it's well worth having."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,This jacket is not waterproof,1.0,"I bought this jacket because it was advertised as waterproof. I specifically did not buy one that was ""water resistant."" I wore this for a hike for the first time today and as you can see from the picture, it is not waterproof.I came back soaked from the hike. I wish I could give this product a zero because it does not work as advertised. DO NOT BUY this if you will be in the rain for any prolonged period of time."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,but its basically been like this since the first time I wore it in ...,1.0,"I've had this jacket for a while, a bit over a year now, and this is definitely not a rain jacket. The jacket is waterproof only for very short periods of time. If I wear it in heavy rain walking from my car into my office building, by the time I get to my desk, a less than 2 minute trip total, water is already starting so soak through and the inside of the back of the jacket is starting to get damp. Unfortunately I discovered this well after the return window, but its basically been like this since the first time I wore it in rain, about 2 months after purchase.Now, it never gets particularly soaked, but some water definitely permeates the jacket, and does so pretty quickly. Just to make sure it wasn't sweat and body humidity accumulating inside the jacket, I hung it on a chair, sprayed it down with a hose in the middle of the back, where there are no seams. After spraying I checked the inside was still dry, and let it sit for about 5 minutes. Coming back, it was damp inside. Putting the jacket on, it was damp enough I could feel the wetness on my back through the wicking polo shirt I had on almost immediately, but  not so wet that my shirt looked wet when I took it off.Despite being somewhat water permeable, it isn't very breathable.Wearing this jacket in pre-storm weather on a warm summer day will very quickly result in a lot of sweat accumulating inside the jacket.This  jacket is really more of a ""water resistant, non breathable windbreaker"" than anything else. Not impressed. I prefer my windbreakers to be much more breathable than this. I prefer my raincoats to be waterproof enough to stand in the rain for a half hour without getting wet. This jacket doesn't fit either.Perhaps I got a bad one, as there are some reviews like mine, and others claiming it is waterproof. Maybe some waterproof coating gets sprayed on at the factory and they forgot mine. Whatever the case, this isn't really a raincoat."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,"Excellent Fit, Great Price",4.0,"This jacket does exactly what it's supposed to do: packs small and keeps me dry when I need it. The fit is great (runs a bit big, so I ordered one size down), and the price can't be beat. It really inspired me to vote Donald Trump out in November."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Unlined sleeves: it does matter,3.0,"This came quick, fits as expected and repels water just as advertised.And while I knew this ahead of time, I had no idea why this little fact was important until I wore it a few times: the sleeves aren't lined.I live on the central Oregon coast. It is mostly wet all the time. Thus, you tend to make your decisions when you head outside based on whether you care you are getting wet or not. If you care, you put on your big, ol' coat and head out. If you don't, then just head out sans coat and get wet.As I get older, the less I enjoy the ""I'll just get wet"" option. So I got this thinking it would serve well in the scenarios where I ordinarily would just suffer getting wet. This was small and light and would be a quick way to stay dry without overheating.Except that the sleeves aren't lined.So, if it is a fairly nice day, but raining as usual, and you toss this over your short sleeves and head to the garage, by the time you get there, it will be stuck to your arms like a wetsuit. This isn't because of the outside rain. This is due to the trapped moisture *inside* the coat. Thus, the second the moisture impervious material comes in contact with your arms, it sticks to them. Which is not a nice feeling. In fact, the feeling is pretty much exactly ""I can't wait to get this thing off me.""So, it is useless on days where the temperature says short sleeves but the clouds say rain.I will keep it as in colder temperatures, it is easier than dealing with a heavy coat for quick outdoor adventures.But it isn't functional in the ways I had hoped."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Should be called a windbreaker NOT a rain jacket,1.0,"We just received this item last week and my husband had a chance to use it this past weekend when we were in the mountains. It rained off and on quite a bit and during the first time it rained, which was NOT a downpour just regular light rain, it soaked through the jacket material and onto his shirt leaving wet spots. So, Columbia's name for this jacket is definitely a bit of a stretch."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,All-in-all a good rain jacket to use for years to come,5.0,"Bought this rain jacket for my teenage son. Part of me wanted the rain jacket I bought for him to have more substance to it, but that's not the point of a spring rain jacket. This has no soft lining because it's not supposed to. We live in Virginia where you typically (not this year!) have only a handful of days that are spring warm/hot but significantly raining. So even your lightweight winter hooded jacket is too warm for the weather but a non-rain resistant spring jacket won't do either. We hate having to carry umbrellas, so this lightweight, hooded rain jacket does the trick. I bought Columbia thinking that he can own it for years to come since he's done with all of his major growth spurts & our area typically doesn't have enough of these days to justify buying a new one every year for a growing kid. It's also very squishable/packable, so it's the kind of thing that I would recommend he throw into every duffle/suitcase he packs for trips as a ""just in case"" kind of thing that takes up so little room & adds so little weight to your luggage that you're grateful if you need it & you don't really mind that you brought it even if you didn't end up needing it."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Sauna Jacket,1.0,"While this jacket has some mesh lining, it is only on the front portions near the zipper. The rest of the inside is open to the inside liner that acts as more of a sauna than anything else. The inside of the sleeves stick to my arms at the first sign of perspiration and that is with wearing the jacket in cool temperatures (in the 40 to 50 degree range Fahrenheit) . The jacket uses Velcro patches to secure away the rain hood and uses the same means to secure an inside pouch that it touts one is able to use to store the jacket in on itself. I am weary of using the Velcro patches as the ones around the hood already show some strain in the stitches used to secure them. This is the second jacket that I ordered that used the Velcro means to secure the hood - I returned the first as the Velcro patches on it already had the stitching pulling out completely."
Columbia Men's Glennaker Lake Rain Jacket,Fits great and keeps you dry!,5.0,"First off gotta say I love this. Very happy I got it! There’s some things I wish were different and I’ll get into that but overall I think it’s a solid buy.Size: So I’m 6’4” and about 340lbs. The sizing was confusing when buying so I kept looking on other reviews etc to guess. Almost bought a 3Xl but I’m glad I went with the 4Xl instead. A little big but not unflattering. In fact it felt better and more breathable that way. So if you’re a big guy there’s big sizes for you!Design pros: Bought for deep sea fishing but honestly, I think I’d rock this even as a rainy day jacket! It’s got a nice style! Cons: lack of lining inside the sleeves can make it feel a bit clammy if you have nothing under and it’s resting just on your skin. Also, the straps at the wrists only help make it smaller not bigger as I was assuming so it’s not something you can role up your sleeves with.Pockets are a bit underwhelming as they’re made of a very flimsy feeling mesh(may not actually be flimsy) but I did not feel safe having anything important in my pockets.All that being said? I would still really Recommend this especially for bigger guys as our options are limited!"

Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,No BS light jacket,5.0,"I've owned and worn the same Levi denim jacket for over 30 years (no, not all the time: that would be weird).  It still looks great but occasionally shrinks up (usually after Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years...) and I wanted a larger version to wear during these odd times of unexplained shrinkening (oh shut up spell check: if I make up a word, I get to decide how it's spelled) .  My wife is, even as I type, offering rather malicious theories on the unexplained shrinkening and I'm suggesting that she obviously does not know the meaning of unexplained.  I apparently have no brand loyalty as I didn't even notice I'd ordered a different jacket until I held the 2 up side by side to compare.  Meh: close enough.  No pads, zippers, epaulets, or any other unnecessary adornments.  Just a classic, clean, light jacket."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Tough jean jacket with a roomy fit for a man who works with his hands,5.0,"I have worn jean jackets over the years for actual work, not fashion. Thus, I look for my jean jackets to have room in the upper back, shoulder, armpit, and chest regions so that I can freely move, unrestrained. I also look for the denim to be thick and tough so that it won't easily tear if it snags on something.I can no longer wear Levi's jean jackets because even the XXL size fits like a medium and has zero room in those regions that I listed above. I bought this Wrangler jean jacket and it is PERFECT. It has room everywhere, but isn't bulky, it's tough, the color is wonderful, it's warm, and it fits how a man's denim jacket should fit: stylish, but roomy and tough for real work. I usually wear XXL for my tops because I'm a muscular man with a broad back/chest and regular sizes don't fit and the typical companies like Levi make even their XL+ sizes super tiny. This XXL Wrangler, however, fits exactly how a XXL should and I love it.I 100% recommend this Wrangler jean jacket!"
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,"Great look, strong, comfortable",5.0,"Don't bother with that other brand that charges more than double for this still style jacket. If you ever owned a denim back in the day you probably had Levi or Lee. Well, take my advise. I've been everywhere and seen everything. This jacket fits perfect, sturdy, stitches are perfect. Buttons are in for life. Nothing more can be said that wasn't mentioned already. My review is if you want a denim, grab this one. The price is unbelievable. And if you think a name and more money is going to get you some better material and workmanship, your being fooled. I went that route. Sent it back on my for this one got money back! being it was 1/3 cheaper. I didn't care about money, I wanted a good denim. Jumped the gun and went top shelf. Take my word, grab a Wrangler. Came in 2 days, inside pockets, etc... Mine is blue and I noticed only a tiny bit of color run after 2 washes. Slightly shrunk but I honestly didn't notice. I bought a 2x. I'm 190, 6'1"". I wanted it slightly bulky in order to wear clothes understand underneath. My experience these were always good at keeping in the heat anyway. Don't hesitate you'll be sorry you didn't get one a month from now on the fall."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,"Very sturdy, wouldn't rip easily",5.0,"Very sturdy, wouldn't rip easily. It's warm enough for winter but wouldn't be too hot for a breezy summer day. I put patches on it and it turned out exactly how I wanted. It has six pockets. Two pockets on the chest, two pockets down by your hands, and two pockets on the inside of the coat. The pockets are all good size. I've put bottles of water in the inside pockets before and it worked great (perfect jacket to sneak snacks into a movie theater with;D)"
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,great for girls too,5.0,"i'm a girl, and i love this jacket. i was looking for something big and spacious and i want to sew patches on it. i ordered the xl like i do nearly everything else but it was ginormous. i love that there are free returns! i reordered the medium and it fits SO well. big still but not too baggy and i can roll the sleeves up or wear them down, both look good. im very happy with this jacket!"
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Best Denim Jacket Made,5.0,"I've been wanting a nice denim jacket again for awhile now. I've been searching in almost every retail store in the area I live and nobody sells demin jackets no more. I had a Levi jacket years ago and it was a nice jacket. I saw these Wrangler jackets on here and read some of the reviews. So I ordered one in charcoal. When I received it I washed it right away because most denims are stiff and not very soft. When I finally put it on I was amazed how nice this jacket fit. These jackets are very well constructed and very sturdy. This is one nice jacket. It's got 2 pockets on the inside which the description fails to mention. I loved this jacket so much I ordered one in every color. Very satisfied customer, Wrangler rocked this one. I would highly recommend this jacket."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Off color denim jacket...,3.0,"If you just want the blue denim ones you may don't going to have issues with the colors but I choose the 'Moss' and the first I ordered arrived with a stain and the color wasn't even close to the picture. The second jacket arrived in two days thanks to Amazon great customer services, but the color again was very different from the 'Moss' color in the picture, so I give up trying. Quality and fit are good but it's a shame that they can't produce a consistent and or accurate color.  I do believe that the picture is a misrepresentation of the 'Moss' jacket color. On the attached picture the jacket on top was the very first jacket (not showing the nasty stain) and the one at the bottom is the replacement."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,"Quality construction, comfortable, dependable, American. Look no further for a great jean jacket.",5.0,"My third one in about 17 years. I've handed down the first two to my children who continue to wear them. The fit is very comfortable but stylish. It's a no-nonsense jacket that does what it is meant to do. You can pay more for upmarket brands that look virtually the same but you don't need to. I wear it often in my convertible in the spring and fall and just chuck it in the washing machine when it starts to smell like exhaust. It has protected my arms from welding sparks (though it's not a safety garment, just saying) and my back from Kato-like sneak attacks by the Golden Retriever. In none of the 3 jackets I've owned over the years have I discovered any defects in manufacture, any substandard quality in buttons, denim, or stitching, or any issues with fit. They break in easy and provide years of comfort. I'm 5'8"", 180lbs and an XL is perfect for me because I often wear it over pullovers in the fall or on my motorcycle. If you aren't going to wear it even partially-buttoned or seated, someone my size might prefer a large."

I was stuck between whether to get 2XL or 3XL and the latter is perfect.  I carry most of my weight in my gut and this fits completely fine when buttoned.  Generally, arm lengths are too short on me but these are perfect.  I included a picture of the inside pocket since someone had asked in a previous comment.  You can compare the height and width of the pocket to the buttons and get an idea of how big it is.  Material appears rugged and ready for wear.  From previous feedback, I have cold washed it to get the initial dye out and will update this comment if anything significant changes after the wash.

Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,You cannot ask for a better denim jacket,5.0,"My previous denim jackets have been Levi (my gut outgrew them) and I had no idea what to expect from a Wrangler. I wear their jeans and like them a lot so I had high hopes for their jacket. I was not disappointment!The fit was actually much better than I expected. Rarely do off-the-rack clothes fit me very well. Usually if the chest and shoulders fit comfortably then the sleeves will be too long or if the gut fits then the shoulders are loose. Not so with this jacket - it is tailored for a real person.The quality is very good; nice weight denim with solid seams. Some of the button holes are almost too tight, requiring a bit of effort to open, but I prefer the button holes start out tight/stiff and then loosen over time rather than start out easy and get sloppy as the denim softens.The denim is fairly stiff brand new but a couple of washings with fabric softener and some wear is softening it up nicely.I have already sewn a couple of patches to the jacket and will be painting the back soon. I have no doubt I will get many years use out of this jacket."

Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,"6' 1"" tall and 310lbs = 3XL",5.0,"I just received this jacket today and am very, very impressed.  I was stuck between whether to get 2XL or 3XL and the latter is perfect.  I carry most of my weight in my gut and this fits completely fine when buttoned.  Generally, arm lengths are too short on me but these are perfect.  I included a picture of the inside pocket since someone had asked in a previous comment.  You can compare the height and width of the pocket to the buttons and get an idea of how big it is.  Material appears rugged and ready for wear.  From previous feedback, I have cold washed it to get the initial dye out and will update this comment if anything significant changes after the wash.  I can't believe that I was able to find a denim jacket this good for this price!!"
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,You cannot ask for a better denim jacket,5.0,"My previous denim jackets have been Levi (my gut outgrew them) and I had no idea what to expect from a Wrangler. I wear their jeans and like them a lot so I had high hopes for their jacket. I was not disappointment!The fit was actually much better than I expected. Rarely do off-the-rack clothes fit me very well. Usually if the chest and shoulders fit comfortably then the sleeves will be too long or if the gut fits then the shoulders are loose. Not so with this jacket - it is tailored for a real person.The quality is very good; nice weight denim with solid seams. Some of the button holes are almost too tight, requiring a bit of effort to open, but I prefer the button holes start out tight/stiff and then loosen over time rather than start out easy and get sloppy as the denim softens.The denim is fairly stiff brand new but a couple of washings with fabric softener and some wear is softening it up nicely.I have already sewn a couple of patches to the jacket and will be painting the back soon. I have no doubt I will get many years use out of this jacket."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,No BS light jacket,5.0,"I've owned and worn the same Levi denim jacket for over 30 years (no, not all the time: that would be weird).  It still looks great but occasionally shrinks up (usually after Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years...) and I wanted a larger version to wear during these odd times of unexplained shrinkening (oh shut up spell check: if I make up a word, I get to decide how it's spelled) .  My wife is, even as I type, offering rather malicious theories on the unexplained shrinkening and I'm suggesting that she obviously does not know the meaning of unexplained.  I apparently have no brand loyalty as I didn't even notice I'd ordered a different jacket until I held the 2 up side by side to compare.  Meh: close enough.  No pads, zippers, epaulets, or any other unnecessary adornments.  Just a classic, clean, light jacket."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Tough jean jacket with a roomy fit for a man who works with his hands,5.0,"I have worn jean jackets over the years for actual work, not fashion. Thus, I look for my jean jackets to have room in the upper back, shoulder, armpit, and chest regions so that I can freely move, unrestrained. I also look for the denim to be thick and tough so that it won't easily tear if it snags on something.I can no longer wear Levi's jean jackets because even the XXL size fits like a medium and has zero room in those regions that I listed above. I bought this Wrangler jean jacket and it is PERFECT. It has room everywhere, but isn't bulky, it's tough, the color is wonderful, it's warm, and it fits how a man's denim jacket should fit: stylish, but roomy and tough for real work. I usually wear XXL for my tops because I'm a muscular man with a broad back/chest and regular sizes don't fit and the typical companies like Levi make even their XL+ sizes super tiny. This XXL Wrangler, however, fits exactly how a XXL should and I love it.I 100% recommend this Wrangler jean jacket!"
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,"Great look, strong, comfortable",5.0,"Don't bother with that other brand that charges more than double for this still style jacket. If you ever owned a denim back in the day you probably had Levi or Lee. Well, take my advise. I've been everywhere and seen everything. This jacket fits perfect, sturdy, stitches are perfect. Buttons are in for life. Nothing more can be said that wasn't mentioned already. My review is if you want a denim, grab this one. The price is unbelievable. And if you think a name and more money is going to get you some better material and workmanship, your being fooled. I went that route. Sent it back on my for this one got money back! being it was 1/3 cheaper. I didn't care about money, I wanted a good denim. Jumped the gun and went top shelf. Take my word, grab a Wrangler. Came in 2 days, inside pockets, etc... Mine is blue and I noticed only a tiny bit of color run after 2 washes. Slightly shrunk but I honestly didn't notice. I bought a 2x. I'm 190, 6'1"". I wanted it slightly bulky in order to wear clothes understand underneath. My experience these were always good at keeping in the heat anyway. Don't hesitate you'll be sorry you didn't get one a month from now on the fall."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,"Very sturdy, wouldn't rip easily",5.0,"Very sturdy, wouldn't rip easily. It's warm enough for winter but wouldn't be too hot for a breezy summer day. I put patches on it and it turned out exactly how I wanted. It has six pockets. Two pockets on the chest, two pockets down by your hands, and two pockets on the inside of the coat. The pockets are all good size. I've put bottles of water in the inside pockets before and it worked great (perfect jacket to sneak snacks into a movie theater with;D)"
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,great for girls too,5.0,"i'm a girl, and i love this jacket. i was looking for something big and spacious and i want to sew patches on it. i ordered the xl like i do nearly everything else but it was ginormous. i love that there are free returns! i reordered the medium and it fits SO well. big still but not too baggy and i can roll the sleeves up or wear them down, both look good. im very happy with this jacket!"
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Best Denim Jacket Made,5.0,"I've been wanting a nice denim jacket again for awhile now. I've been searching in almost every retail store in the area I live and nobody sells demin jackets no more. I had a Levi jacket years ago and it was a nice jacket. I saw these Wrangler jackets on here and read some of the reviews. So I ordered one in charcoal. When I received it I washed it right away because most denims are stiff and not very soft. When I finally put it on I was amazed how nice this jacket fit. These jackets are very well constructed and very sturdy. This is one nice jacket. It's got 2 pockets on the inside which the description fails to mention. I loved this jacket so much I ordered one in every color. Very satisfied customer, Wrangler rocked this one. I would highly recommend this jacket."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,Off color denim jacket...,3.0,"If you just want the blue denim ones you may don't going to have issues with the colors but I choose the 'Moss' and the first I ordered arrived with a stain and the color wasn't even close to the picture. The second jacket arrived in two days thanks to Amazon great customer services, but the color again was very different from the 'Moss' color in the picture, so I give up trying. Quality and fit are good but it's a shame that they can't produce a consistent and or accurate color.  I do believe that the picture is a misrepresentation of the 'Moss' jacket color. On the attached picture the jacket on top was the very first jacket (not showing the nasty stain) and the one at the bottom is the replacement."
Wrangler Men's Rugged Wear Unlined Denim Jacket,"Quality construction, comfortable, dependable, American. Look no further for a great jean jacket.",5.0,"My third one in about 17 years. I've handed down the first two to my children who continue to wear them. The fit is very comfortable but stylish. It's a no-nonsense jacket that does what it is meant to do. You can pay more for upmarket brands that look virtually the same but you don't need to. I wear it often in my convertible in the spring and fall and just chuck it in the washing machine when it starts to smell like exhaust. It has protected my arms from welding sparks (though it's not a safety garment, just saying) and my back from Kato-like sneak attacks by the Golden Retriever. In none of the 3 jackets I've owned over the years have I discovered any defects in manufacture, any substandard quality in buttons, denim, or stitching, or any issues with fit. They break in easy and provide years of comfort. I'm 5'8"", 180lbs and an XL is perfect for me because I often wear it over pullovers in the fall or on my motorcycle. If you aren't going to wear it even partially-buttoned or seated, someone my size might prefer a large."

Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Very poor Quality,1.0,"Jacket fits well and is comfortable to wear. Unfortunately, after one hour of minimal use on normal conditions, it is already leaking down. Its external material it seems it is made off of very poor quality material and the puff material it has started to come out. At $60 price range this would seem like a bargain, specially from a brand like Eddie Bauer, unfortunately due to its quality $60 is way too expensive. This was my first and last time for Eddie Bauer brand products. I even think that these good reviews might be a hoax, or simply, i was unlucky and got the bad quality product."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,"Great buy at the Amazon price, but not worth retail price",4.0,"This jacket is a great bargain at the price it sells for here on Amazon.The retail price is $99, but the Amazon price is $59. This jacket is worth the Amazon price, but is not worth the full retail price. Eddie Bauer does regularly offer 40% off coupons that bring the full price in line with the Amazon price. Eddie Bauer also, occasionally, has a 50% off sale which would bring the price down to $49, that would be a really good bargain.If you want a good deal, pay the Amazon price. If you are in no hurry, wait for a 50$ off sale at Eddie Bauer.Why do I think this is a good deal? This is not the best down jacket you can buy. This should really be thought of as a 'down sweater' and not a jacket. This does not have a lot of features. This has good down, but does not have the highest quality down ( 650 dfp (down fill power) vs 850 dfp or 900 dfp.  This does not have down treated with a hydrophillic process to make the down more water proof. This does not have an outer shell of some super high-tech fabric like dyneema or pertex.However, this is a really good, bargain down jacket.It has quality down. when dfp ratings started being used, 400 to 500 was the most common, ordinary, jacket fill. 650 used to be considered very 'high end'. Most of the ultra-expensive coats and jackets that Canada Goose sells use 650 dfp down. Things have changed and the high end is much higher now, but 650 dfp is still good. Ask anyone who has spent over $1,000 on a Canada Goose jacket with 650 dfp down.There are better jackets that are much more expensive, but this jacket is a good jacket for $59.If the jacket had 2 of any of the following 3 features, I think it would be worth the retail price of $99:1) A hem drawstring, instead of the elastic it has.2) A zippered chest pocket (inside or outside) for a phone.3) a double zipper on one of the pockets, so the jacket can be stored in its own pocket.This jacket lacks all of those features. They are all pretty basic. If it had any 2 of those 3, I'd class it as a $99 jacket.This is not a jacket that will get you across Antartica on a dog sled, but it will meet the needs of many people out there. I've worn this jacket in weather ranging from 0º F to 45º F. Alone, it is good down to about 32º F, if it isn't freezing rain out. Below that temperature, I usually combine it with a fleece hoody underneath this jacket.It was 24ºF today on my way to work and I wore the fleece hoody/EB cirruslite down jacket combo and was pretty warm.  If it is wet out, I'll wear this jacket under a waterproof shell. The coldest weather, and I combine the three layers: Fleece hoody, down sweater, gore-tex shell. That can take me down to the 0º F easily. I'll see if I can use that combo even lower this January. It just hasn't gotten that cold yet.Workmanship is fine. Remember this is a $59 dollar jacket. I found one hanging thread I cut off. It wasn't a loose thread, just extra. The first few days, a few of the very tiny down feathers came out near some seems. I have had this with every down jacket I have owned. The very smallest feathers fit through the larger sew holes. It happens, but it doesn't really leak down.To sum it up, it is worth the price charged here on Amazon. You can get jackets with more feartures, but they cost more. You can get jackets with better down, or better fabrics but you won't get them for $59.Jackets like the Montbell Alpine Lite, REI Magma 850 2.0, or Patagonia down sweater have more features, better fabric and better down. They retail for $209 to $229. You'll see extra features like zipper storm flaps, zippered chest pockets, fleece lined collars, water resistant down and more on these other jackets. Features that are not present on this jacket. They also cost from $140 to $170 more than this jacket does.This is a great bargain for the price, it can be a really good part of any layered winter system, and you can buy 3 or 4 of these for the price of a high end brand name lite down jacket.I've added pictures of the one loose thread, and one of the very small feathers that came out (the feather is so small it is hard to see).I've added pictures of how I layer the jacket with the fleece and the outer shell when needed.This is a good deal, has responsibly sourced down and is pretty well made. If you want more features, there are plenty of other down jackets with more features."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Somewhat cheap and not durable,1.0,"Within a few days of buying, white feathers started coming out of the jacket from random places and the outside material is too delicate and prone to tear for daily use. Yes, it will keep you warm till it lasts ( unfortunately for me it is a couple of weeks). In my case, friction with the backpack led to a tear."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Great looking jacket but not happy with the quality!,2.0,"I bought this jacket for my son back in December.  We were pleasantly surprised by the style, fit and how warm it was in spite of the lightweight feel of the jacket.  This was exactly what he was looking for.  However, today I noticed there is a rip on the upper part of the jacket near the shoulder.  I’m afraid it’s going to get worse. He’s worn the jacket on and off during the last three months.  As far he knows he didn’t do anything to cause this rip.  As much as we love the jacket we are not happy with the quality.  I thought he would have at least been able to wear this jacket for the next couple of years.  Definitely not buying another Eddie Bauer jacket again.  So disappointing because I have been buying Eddie Bauer clothes for my family and I over the years and expected a good quality jacket."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Warm but thin and fragile,3.0,"This jacket does keep you warm and is very soft to the touch.But it's very thin and feels like it would rip if caught on anything even slightly.One of the reviewers said the inside pockets don't have any Velcro to close which makes sense because I think undoing the Velcro would rip the pocket right off.Also after about 2 or 3 weeks of light use, there are a few feathers coming out.  Don't know if this will continue or not.I do like the jacket but given the price I think they could have made it a bit sturdier.Not the level of quality I would associate with Eddie Bauer."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Light and warm,5.0,"I ordered the “Atlantic(Grey)” color and it’s navy blue, not grey. I still kept it because the color doesn’t matter much to me and it’s a good coat. Fits great and super light and comfy. Very warm and blocks the wind well. I’ve been comfortable in 40 degree weather and I’m sure it would be comfortable even lower if you’re active like shoveling snow."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Very pleased with this as my first down jacket,5.0,"This is my first 'puffy' down jacket and I have been very pleased with it overall.  I live in Arizona so most people would be surprised to think we would even need a down jacket here, but this is really great for the cool mornings and evening walks around the community.  It packs down really small and even comes with a small bag for storing it, which comes in handy if you want to throw this jacket in a messenger bag or small backpack.  I love the feel of the jacket overall - it feels like you're being hugged by a nice down sleeping bag all the time.  its amazing that its not TOO hot though either - it really seems to breath well.  There are times when I've worn it around my office at work without even recalling that I was still wearing it - but its just that comfortable overall.  As a camper, I also bring this on car camping type trips for lounging around in the evenings and at meals.  Considering that the outer material is very thin I'm hesitant to wear it hiking or backpacking because I'm afraid it would easily rip.  I also avoid wearing it around a campfire as a small tinder would easily burn a hole in the jacket and I don't want to risk it getting ruined like that.  Great jacket from a trusted vendor!"

Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Perfect for temps 20's-50's; some quality concerns (revised),4.0,"I live in Minneapolis, so have some experience with long winters. I've been looking for a light jacket that was a) comfy, b) warm enough for early/late winter excursions, and c) fashionable. This is it!First, the comfort is terrific. The down is super soft and very lightweight. So light that I was highly skeptical that it'd keep me warm, but it does. Good to bunch up as a pillow on a place, too.Next, the warmth value is good due to the down used throughout the jacket. Once the temp/wind chill dips into the teens and below, it's time to break out the full coat/parka. However, for anything in the 20s-50s, this is my new go-to jacket.Lastly, the jacket really looks good with just about anything. I'll wear it with jeans and a t-shirt on the weekends or chinos and collared shirts for work and the jacket fits the occasions. Also, a note on fit: I'm 6'0"", weigh 190 lbs, and like to wear slim fit shirts for work. I originally ordered a large, but felt that the middle section hung awkwardly. I returned it for a medium, and love the size.I'm very happy with the value. Your biggest ""headache"" will be to make sure you get the right size.*Revised after 2 months of usage*I just added the photo to show where a seam is starting to unravel. I downgraded my rating from 5 to 4 stars because of this. I still love the jacket for reasons listed above, and it's still a great buy for the price. Of course, I wish it'd hold together a bit better."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,"Exceeds the ""Michigan Winter"" Test",5.0,"I got this jacket in a Tall XL expecting it to be a comfortable walking companion for a nice, brisk Michigan Fall day. Unfortunately, Fall lasted about a minute before we were all thrust into the deep freeze: Sleet and snow and temperatures at freezing or below. This jacket exceeds what I expected. Great fit in the body and sleeves. If you dress smartly in layers, this light-weight down jacket will keep you toasty--and you'll look like a boss in it!"

Good to bunch up as a pillow on a place, too.Next, the warmth value is good due to the down used throughout the jacket. Once the temp/wind chill dips into the teens and below, it's time to break out the full coat/parka. However, for anything in the 20s-50s, this is my new go-to jacket.Lastly, the jacket really looks good with just about anything. I'll wear it with jeans and a t-shirt on the weekends or chinos and collared shirts for work and the jacket fits the occasions. Also, a note on fit: I'm 6'0"", weigh 190 lbs, and like to wear slim fit shirts for work. I originally ordered a large, but felt that the middle section hung awkwardly. I returned it for a medium, and love the size.I'm very happy with the value. Your biggest ""headache"" will be to make sure you get the right size.*Revised after 2 months of usage*I just added the photo to show where a seam is starting to unravel. I downgraded my rating from 5 to 4 stars because of this. I still love the jacket for reasons listed above, and it's still a great buy for the price. Of course, I wish it'd hold together a bit better."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,"Exceeds the ""Michigan Winter"" Test",5.0,"I got this jacket in a Tall XL expecting it to be a comfortable walking companion for a nice, brisk Michigan Fall day. Unfortunately, Fall lasted about a minute before we were all thrust into the deep freeze: Sleet and snow and temperatures at freezing or below. This jacket exceeds what I expected. Great fit in the body and sleeves. If you dress smartly in layers, this light-weight down jacket will keep you toasty--and you'll look like a boss in it!"
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Very poor Quality,1.0,"Jacket fits well and is comfortable to wear. Unfortunately, after one hour of minimal use on normal conditions, it is already leaking down. Its external material it seems it is made off of very poor quality material and the puff material it has started to come out. At $60 price range this would seem like a bargain, specially from a brand like Eddie Bauer, unfortunately due to its quality $60 is way too expensive. This was my first and last time for Eddie Bauer brand products. I even think that these good reviews might be a hoax, or simply, i was unlucky and got the bad quality product."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,"Great buy at the Amazon price, but not worth retail price",4.0,"This jacket is a great bargain at the price it sells for here on Amazon.The retail price is $99, but the Amazon price is $59. This jacket is worth the Amazon price, but is not worth the full retail price. Eddie Bauer does regularly offer 40% off coupons that bring the full price in line with the Amazon price. Eddie Bauer also, occasionally, has a 50% off sale which would bring the price down to $49, that would be a really good bargain.If you want a good deal, pay the Amazon price. If you are in no hurry, wait for a 50$ off sale at Eddie Bauer.Why do I think this is a good deal? This is not the best down jacket you can buy. This should really be thought of as a 'down sweater' and not a jacket. This does not have a lot of features. This has good down, but does not have the highest quality down ( 650 dfp (down fill power) vs 850 dfp or 900 dfp.  This does not have down treated with a hydrophillic process to make the down more water proof. This does not have an outer shell of some super high-tech fabric like dyneema or pertex.However, this is a really good, bargain down jacket.It has quality down. when dfp ratings started being used, 400 to 500 was the most common, ordinary, jacket fill. 650 used to be considered very 'high end'. Most of the ultra-expensive coats and jackets that Canada Goose sells use 650 dfp down. Things have changed and the high end is much higher now, but 650 dfp is still good. Ask anyone who has spent over $1,000 on a Canada Goose jacket with 650 dfp down.There are better jackets that are much more expensive, but this jacket is a good jacket for $59.If the jacket had 2 of any of the following 3 features, I think it would be worth the retail price of $99:1) A hem drawstring, instead of the elastic it has.2) A zippered chest pocket (inside or outside) for a phone.3) a double zipper on one of the pockets, so the jacket can be stored in its own pocket.This jacket lacks all of those features. They are all pretty basic. If it had any 2 of those 3, I'd class it as a $99 jacket.This is not a jacket that will get you across Antartica on a dog sled, but it will meet the needs of many people out there. I've worn this jacket in weather ranging from 0º F to 45º F. Alone, it is good down to about 32º F, if it isn't freezing rain out. Below that temperature, I usually combine it with a fleece hoody underneath this jacket.It was 24ºF today on my way to work and I wore the fleece hoody/EB cirruslite down jacket combo and was pretty warm.  If it is wet out, I'll wear this jacket under a waterproof shell. The coldest weather, and I combine the three layers: Fleece hoody, down sweater, gore-tex shell. That can take me down to the 0º F easily. I'll see if I can use that combo even lower this January. It just hasn't gotten that cold yet.Workmanship is fine. Remember this is a $59 dollar jacket. I found one hanging thread I cut off. It wasn't a loose thread, just extra. The first few days, a few of the very tiny down feathers came out near some seems. I have had this with every down jacket I have owned. The very smallest feathers fit through the larger sew holes. It happens, but it doesn't really leak down.To sum it up, it is worth the price charged here on Amazon. You can get jackets with more feartures, but they cost more. You can get jackets with better down, or better fabrics but you won't get them for $59.Jackets like the Montbell Alpine Lite, REI Magma 850 2.0, or Patagonia down sweater have more features, better fabric and better down. They retail for $209 to $229. You'll see extra features like zipper storm flaps, zippered chest pockets, fleece lined collars, water resistant down and more on these other jackets. Features that are not present on this jacket. They also cost from $140 to $170 more than this jacket does.This is a great bargain for the price, it can be a really good part of any layered winter system, and you can buy 3 or 4 of these for the price of a high end brand name lite down jacket.I've added pictures of the one loose thread, and one of the very small feathers that came out (the feather is so small it is hard to see).I've added pictures of how I layer the jacket with the fleece and the outer shell when needed.This is a good deal, has responsibly sourced down and is pretty well made. If you want more features, there are plenty of other down jackets with more features."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Somewhat cheap and not durable,1.0,"Within a few days of buying, white feathers started coming out of the jacket from random places and the outside material is too delicate and prone to tear for daily use. Yes, it will keep you warm till it lasts ( unfortunately for me it is a couple of weeks). In my case, friction with the backpack led to a tear."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Great looking jacket but not happy with the quality!,2.0,"I bought this jacket for my son back in December.  We were pleasantly surprised by the style, fit and how warm it was in spite of the lightweight feel of the jacket.  This was exactly what he was looking for.  However, today I noticed there is a rip on the upper part of the jacket near the shoulder.  I’m afraid it’s going to get worse. He’s worn the jacket on and off during the last three months.  As far he knows he didn’t do anything to cause this rip.  As much as we love the jacket we are not happy with the quality.  I thought he would have at least been able to wear this jacket for the next couple of years.  Definitely not buying another Eddie Bauer jacket again.  So disappointing because I have been buying Eddie Bauer clothes for my family and I over the years and expected a good quality jacket."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Warm but thin and fragile,3.0,"This jacket does keep you warm and is very soft to the touch.But it's very thin and feels like it would rip if caught on anything even slightly.One of the reviewers said the inside pockets don't have any Velcro to close which makes sense because I think undoing the Velcro would rip the pocket right off.Also after about 2 or 3 weeks of light use, there are a few feathers coming out.  Don't know if this will continue or not.I do like the jacket but given the price I think they could have made it a bit sturdier.Not the level of quality I would associate with Eddie Bauer."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Light and warm,5.0,"I ordered the “Atlantic(Grey)” color and it’s navy blue, not grey. I still kept it because the color doesn’t matter much to me and it’s a good coat. Fits great and super light and comfy. Very warm and blocks the wind well. I’ve been comfortable in 40 degree weather and I’m sure it would be comfortable even lower if you’re active like shoveling snow."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Very pleased with this as my first down jacket,5.0,"This is my first 'puffy' down jacket and I have been very pleased with it overall.  I live in Arizona so most people would be surprised to think we would even need a down jacket here, but this is really great for the cool mornings and evening walks around the community.  It packs down really small and even comes with a small bag for storing it, which comes in handy if you want to throw this jacket in a messenger bag or small backpack.  I love the feel of the jacket overall - it feels like you're being hugged by a nice down sleeping bag all the time.  its amazing that its not TOO hot though either - it really seems to breath well.  There are times when I've worn it around my office at work without even recalling that I was still wearing it - but its just that comfortable overall.  As a camper, I also bring this on car camping type trips for lounging around in the evenings and at meals.  Considering that the outer material is very thin I'm hesitant to wear it hiking or backpacking because I'm afraid it would easily rip.  I also avoid wearing it around a campfire as a small tinder would easily burn a hole in the jacket and I don't want to risk it getting ruined like that.  Great jacket from a trusted vendor!"

I’ve been comfortable in 40 degree weather and I’m sure it would be comfortable even lower if you’re active like shoveling snow."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Very pleased with this as my first down jacket,5.0,"This is my first 'puffy' down jacket and I have been very pleased with it overall.  I live in Arizona so most people would be surprised to think we would even need a down jacket here, but this is really great for the cool mornings and evening walks around the community.  It packs down really small and even comes with a small bag for storing it, which comes in handy if you want to throw this jacket in a messenger bag or small backpack.  I love the feel of the jacket overall - it feels like you're being hugged by a nice down sleeping bag all the time.  its amazing that its not TOO hot though either - it really seems to breath well.  There are times when I've worn it around my office at work without even recalling that I was still wearing it - but its just that comfortable overall.  As a camper, I also bring this on car camping type trips for lounging around in the evenings and at meals.  Considering that the outer material is very thin I'm hesitant to wear it hiking or backpacking because I'm afraid it would easily rip.  I also avoid wearing it around a campfire as a small tinder would easily burn a hole in the jacket and I don't want to risk it getting ruined like that.  Great jacket from a trusted vendor!"
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,but it fits great and looks cool,4.0,"Arrived today and too warm to wear, but it fits great and looks cool. It's very lite and soft!  I must be careful not to get it caught on anything, material seems delicate but I guess that is to be expected with these jackets. I am very pleased with my purchase!!!

Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Perfect for temps 20's-50's; some quality concerns (revised),4.0,"I live in Minneapolis, so have some experience with long winters. I've been looking for a light jacket that was a) comfy, b) warm enough for early/late winter excursions, and c) fashionable. This is it!First, the comfort is terrific. The down is super soft and very lightweight. So light that I was highly skeptical that it'd keep me warm, but it does. Good to bunch up as a pillow on a place, too.Next, the warmth value is good due to the down used throughout the jacket. Once the temp/wind chill dips into the teens and below, it's time to break out the full coat/parka. However, for anything in the 20s-50s, this is my new go-to jacket.Lastly, the jacket really looks good with just about anything. I'll wear it with jeans and a t-shirt on the weekends or chinos and collared shirts for work and the jacket fits the occasions. Also, a note on fit: I'm 6'0"", weigh 190 lbs, and like to wear slim fit shirts for work. I originally ordered a large, but felt that the middle section hung awkwardly. I returned it for a medium, and love the size.I'm very happy with the value. Your biggest ""headache"" will be to make sure you get the right size.*Revised after 2 months of usage*I just added the photo to show where a seam is starting to unravel. I downgraded my rating from 5 to 4 stars because of this. I still love the jacket for reasons listed above, and it's still a great buy for the price. Of course, I wish it'd hold together a bit better."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,"Exceeds the ""Michigan Winter"" Test",5.0,"I got this jacket in a Tall XL expecting it to be a comfortable walking companion for a nice, brisk Michigan Fall day. Unfortunately, Fall lasted about a minute before we were all thrust into the deep freeze: Sleet and snow and temperatures at freezing or below. This jacket exceeds what I expected. Great fit in the body and sleeves. If you dress smartly in layers, this light-weight down jacket will keep you toasty--and you'll look like a boss in it!"
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Very poor Quality,1.0,"Jacket fits well and is comfortable to wear. Unfortunately, after one hour of minimal use on normal conditions, it is already leaking down. Its external material it seems it is made off of very poor quality material and the puff material it has started to come out. At $60 price range this would seem like a bargain, specially from a brand like Eddie Bauer, unfortunately due to its quality $60 is way too expensive. This was my first and last time for Eddie Bauer brand products. I even think that these good reviews might be a hoax, or simply, i was unlucky and got the bad quality product."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,"Great buy at the Amazon price, but not worth retail price",4.0,"This jacket is a great bargain at the price it sells for here on Amazon.The retail price is $99, but the Amazon price is $59. This jacket is worth the Amazon price, but is not worth the full retail price. Eddie Bauer does regularly offer 40% off coupons that bring the full price in line with the Amazon price. Eddie Bauer also, occasionally, has a 50% off sale which would bring the price down to $49, that would be a really good bargain.If you want a good deal, pay the Amazon price. If you are in no hurry, wait for a 50$ off sale at Eddie Bauer.Why do I think this is a good deal? This is not the best down jacket you can buy. This should really be thought of as a 'down sweater' and not a jacket. This does not have a lot of features. This has good down, but does not have the highest quality down ( 650 dfp (down fill power) vs 850 dfp or 900 dfp.  This does not have down treated with a hydrophillic process to make the down more water proof. This does not have an outer shell of some super high-tech fabric like dyneema or pertex.However, this is a really good, bargain down jacket.It has quality down. when dfp ratings started being used, 400 to 500 was the most common, ordinary, jacket fill. 650 used to be considered very 'high end'. Most of the ultra-expensive coats and jackets that Canada Goose sells use 650 dfp down. Things have changed and the high end is much higher now, but 650 dfp is still good. Ask anyone who has spent over $1,000 on a Canada Goose jacket with 650 dfp down.There are better jackets that are much more expensive, but this jacket is a good jacket for $59.If the jacket had 2 of any of the following 3 features, I think it would be worth the retail price of $99:1) A hem drawstring, instead of the elastic it has.2) A zippered chest pocket (inside or outside) for a phone.3) a double zipper on one of the pockets, so the jacket can be stored in its own pocket.This jacket lacks all of those features. They are all pretty basic. If it had any 2 of those 3, I'd class it as a $99 jacket.This is not a jacket that will get you across Antartica on a dog sled, but it will meet the needs of many people out there. I've worn this jacket in weather ranging from 0º F to 45º F. Alone, it is good down to about 32º F, if it isn't freezing rain out. Below that temperature, I usually combine it with a fleece hoody underneath this jacket.It was 24ºF today on my way to work and I wore the fleece hoody/EB cirruslite down jacket combo and was pretty warm.  If it is wet out, I'll wear this jacket under a waterproof shell. The coldest weather, and I combine the three layers: Fleece hoody, down sweater, gore-tex shell. That can take me down to the 0º F easily. I'll see if I can use that combo even lower this January. It just hasn't gotten that cold yet.Workmanship is fine. Remember this is a $59 dollar jacket. I found one hanging thread I cut off. It wasn't a loose thread, just extra. The first few days, a few of the very tiny down feathers came out near some seems. I have had this with every down jacket I have owned. The very smallest feathers fit through the larger sew holes. It happens, but it doesn't really leak down.To sum it up, it is worth the price charged here on Amazon. You can get jackets with more feartures, but they cost more. You can get jackets with better down, or better fabrics but you won't get them for $59.Jackets like the Montbell Alpine Lite, REI Magma 850 2.0, or Patagonia down sweater have more features, better fabric and better down. They retail for $209 to $229. You'll see extra features like zipper storm flaps, zippered chest pockets, fleece lined collars, water resistant down and more on these other jackets. Features that are not present on this jacket. They also cost from $140 to $170 more than this jacket does.This is a great bargain for the price, it can be a really good part of any layered winter system, and you can buy 3 or 4 of these for the price of a high end brand name lite down jacket.I've added pictures of the one loose thread, and one of the very small feathers that came out (the feather is so small it is hard to see).I've added pictures of how I layer the jacket with the fleece and the outer shell when needed.This is a good deal, has responsibly sourced down and is pretty well made. If you want more features, there are plenty of other down jackets with more features."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Somewhat cheap and not durable,1.0,"Within a few days of buying, white feathers started coming out of the jacket from random places and the outside material is too delicate and prone to tear for daily use. Yes, it will keep you warm till it lasts ( unfortunately for me it is a couple of weeks). In my case, friction with the backpack led to a tear."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Great looking jacket but not happy with the quality!,2.0,"I bought this jacket for my son back in December.  We were pleasantly surprised by the style, fit and how warm it was in spite of the lightweight feel of the jacket.  This was exactly what he was looking for.  However, today I noticed there is a rip on the upper part of the jacket near the shoulder.  I’m afraid it’s going to get worse. He’s worn the jacket on and off during the last three months.  As far he knows he didn’t do anything to cause this rip.  As much as we love the jacket we are not happy with the quality.  I thought he would have at least been able to wear this jacket for the next couple of years.  Definitely not buying another Eddie Bauer jacket again.  So disappointing because I have been buying Eddie Bauer clothes for my family and I over the years and expected a good quality jacket."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Warm but thin and fragile,3.0,"This jacket does keep you warm and is very soft to the touch.But it's very thin and feels like it would rip if caught on anything even slightly.One of the reviewers said the inside pockets don't have any Velcro to close which makes sense because I think undoing the Velcro would rip the pocket right off.Also after about 2 or 3 weeks of light use, there are a few feathers coming out.  Don't know if this will continue or not.I do like the jacket but given the price I think they could have made it a bit sturdier.Not the level of quality I would associate with Eddie Bauer."

They also cost from $140 to $170 more than this jacket does.This is a great bargain for the price, it can be a really good part of any layered winter system, and you can buy 3 or 4 of these for the price of a high end brand name lite down jacket.I've added pictures of the one loose thread, and one of the very small feathers that came out (the feather is so small it is hard to see).I've added pictures of how I layer the jacket with the fleece and the outer shell when needed.This is a good deal, has responsibly sourced down and is pretty well made. If you want more features, there are plenty of other down jackets with more features."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Somewhat cheap and not durable,1.0,"Within a few days of buying, white feathers started coming out of the jacket from random places and the outside material is too delicate and prone to tear for daily use. Yes, it will keep you warm till it lasts ( unfortunately for me it is a couple of weeks). In my case, friction with the backpack led to a tear."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Great looking jacket but not happy with the quality!,2.0,"I bought this jacket for my son back in December.  We were pleasantly surprised by the style, fit and how warm it was in spite of the lightweight feel of the jacket.  This was exactly what he was looking for.  However, today I noticed there is a rip on the upper part of the jacket near the shoulder.  I’m afraid it’s going to get worse. He’s worn the jacket on and off during the last three months.  As far he knows he didn’t do anything to cause this rip.  As much as we love the jacket we are not happy with the quality.  I thought he would have at least been able to wear this jacket for the next couple of years.  Definitely not buying another Eddie Bauer jacket again.  So disappointing because I have been buying Eddie Bauer clothes for my family and I over the years and expected a good quality jacket."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Warm but thin and fragile,3.0,"This jacket does keep you warm and is very soft to the touch.But it's very thin and feels like it would rip if caught on anything even slightly.One of the reviewers said the inside pockets don't have any Velcro to close which makes sense because I think undoing the Velcro would rip the pocket right off.Also after about 2 or 3 weeks of light use, there are a few feathers coming out.  Don't know if this will continue or not.I do like the jacket but given the price I think they could have made it a bit sturdier.Not the level of quality I would associate with Eddie Bauer."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Light and warm,5.0,"I ordered the “Atlantic(Grey)” color and it’s navy blue, not grey. I still kept it because the color doesn’t matter much to me and it’s a good coat. Fits great and super light and comfy. Very warm and blocks the wind well. I’ve been comfortable in 40 degree weather and I’m sure it would be comfortable even lower if you’re active like shoveling snow."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Very pleased with this as my first down jacket,5.0,"This is my first 'puffy' down jacket and I have been very pleased with it overall.  I live in Arizona so most people would be surprised to think we would even need a down jacket here, but this is really great for the cool mornings and evening walks around the community.  It packs down really small and even comes with a small bag for storing it, which comes in handy if you want to throw this jacket in a messenger bag or small backpack.  I love the feel of the jacket overall - it feels like you're being hugged by a nice down sleeping bag all the time.  its amazing that its not TOO hot though either - it really seems to breath well.  There are times when I've worn it around my office at work without even recalling that I was still wearing it - but its just that comfortable overall.  As a camper, I also bring this on car camping type trips for lounging around in the evenings and at meals.  Considering that the outer material is very thin I'm hesitant to wear it hiking or backpacking because I'm afraid it would easily rip.  I also avoid wearing it around a campfire as a small tinder would easily burn a hole in the jacket and I don't want to risk it getting ruined like that.  Great jacket from a trusted vendor!"

Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Perfect for temps 20's-50's; some quality concerns (revised),4.0,"I live in Minneapolis, so have some experience with long winters. I've been looking for a light jacket that was a) comfy, b) warm enough for early/late winter excursions, and c) fashionable. This is it!First, the comfort is terrific. The down is super soft and very lightweight. So light that I was highly skeptical that it'd keep me warm, but it does. Good to bunch up as a pillow on a place, too.Next, the warmth value is good due to the down used throughout the jacket. Once the temp/wind chill dips into the teens and below, it's time to break out the full coat/parka. However, for anything in the 20s-50s, this is my new go-to jacket.Lastly, the jacket really looks good with just about anything. I'll wear it with jeans and a t-shirt on the weekends or chinos and collared shirts for work and the jacket fits the occasions. Also, a note on fit: I'm 6'0"", weigh 190 lbs, and like to wear slim fit shirts for work. I originally ordered a large, but felt that the middle section hung awkwardly. I returned it for a medium, and love the size.I'm very happy with the value. Your biggest ""headache"" will be to make sure you get the right size.*Revised after 2 months of usage*I just added the photo to show where a seam is starting to unravel. I downgraded my rating from 5 to 4 stars because of this. I still love the jacket for reasons listed above, and it's still a great buy for the price. Of course, I wish it'd hold together a bit better."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,"Exceeds the ""Michigan Winter"" Test",5.0,"I got this jacket in a Tall XL expecting it to be a comfortable walking companion for a nice, brisk Michigan Fall day. Unfortunately, Fall lasted about a minute before we were all thrust into the deep freeze: Sleet and snow and temperatures at freezing or below. This jacket exceeds what I expected. Great fit in the body and sleeves. If you dress smartly in layers, this light-weight down jacket will keep you toasty--and you'll look like a boss in it!"
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Very poor Quality,1.0,"Jacket fits well and is comfortable to wear. Unfortunately, after one hour of minimal use on normal conditions, it is already leaking down. Its external material it seems it is made off of very poor quality material and the puff material it has started to come out. At $60 price range this would seem like a bargain, specially from a brand like Eddie Bauer, unfortunately due to its quality $60 is way too expensive. This was my first and last time for Eddie Bauer brand products. I even think that these good reviews might be a hoax, or simply, i was unlucky and got the bad quality product."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,"Great buy at the Amazon price, but not worth retail price",4.0,"This jacket is a great bargain at the price it sells for here on Amazon.The retail price is $99, but the Amazon price is $59. This jacket is worth the Amazon price, but is not worth the full retail price. Eddie Bauer does regularly offer 40% off coupons that bring the full price in line with the Amazon price. Eddie Bauer also, occasionally, has a 50% off sale which would bring the price down to $49, that would be a really good bargain.If you want a good deal, pay the Amazon price. If you are in no hurry, wait for a 50$ off sale at Eddie Bauer.Why do I think this is a good deal? This is not the best down jacket you can buy. This should really be thought of as a 'down sweater' and not a jacket. This does not have a lot of features. This has good down, but does not have the highest quality down ( 650 dfp (down fill power) vs 850 dfp or 900 dfp.  This does not have down treated with a hydrophillic process to make the down more water proof. This does not have an outer shell of some super high-tech fabric like dyneema or pertex.However, this is a really good, bargain down jacket.It has quality down. when dfp ratings started being used, 400 to 500 was the most common, ordinary, jacket fill. 650 used to be considered very 'high end'. Most of the ultra-expensive coats and jackets that Canada Goose sells use 650 dfp down. Things have changed and the high end is much higher now, but 650 dfp is still good. Ask anyone who has spent over $1,000 on a Canada Goose jacket with 650 dfp down.There are better jackets that are much more expensive, but this jacket is a good jacket for $59.If the jacket had 2 of any of the following 3 features, I think it would be worth the retail price of $99:1) A hem drawstring, instead of the elastic it has.2) A zippered chest pocket (inside or outside) for a phone.3) a double zipper on one of the pockets, so the jacket can be stored in its own pocket.This jacket lacks all of those features. They are all pretty basic. If it had any 2 of those 3, I'd class it as a $99 jacket.This is not a jacket that will get you across Antartica on a dog sled, but it will meet the needs of many people out there. I've worn this jacket in weather ranging from 0º F to 45º F. Alone, it is good down to about 32º F, if it isn't freezing rain out. Below that temperature, I usually combine it with a fleece hoody underneath this jacket.It was 24ºF today on my way to work and I wore the fleece hoody/EB cirruslite down jacket combo and was pretty warm.  If it is wet out, I'll wear this jacket under a waterproof shell. The coldest weather, and I combine the three layers: Fleece hoody, down sweater, gore-tex shell. That can take me down to the 0º F easily. I'll see if I can use that combo even lower this January. It just hasn't gotten that cold yet.Workmanship is fine. Remember this is a $59 dollar jacket. I found one hanging thread I cut off. It wasn't a loose thread, just extra. The first few days, a few of the very tiny down feathers came out near some seems. I have had this with every down jacket I have owned. The very smallest feathers fit through the larger sew holes. It happens, but it doesn't really leak down.To sum it up, it is worth the price charged here on Amazon. You can get jackets with more feartures, but they cost more. You can get jackets with better down, or better fabrics but you won't get them for $59.Jackets like the Montbell Alpine Lite, REI Magma 850 2.0, or Patagonia down sweater have more features, better fabric and better down. They retail for $209 to $229. You'll see extra features like zipper storm flaps, zippered chest pockets, fleece lined collars, water resistant down and more on these other jackets. Features that are not present on this jacket. They also cost from $140 to $170 more than this jacket does.This is a great bargain for the price, it can be a really good part of any layered winter system, and you can buy 3 or 4 of these for the price of a high end brand name lite down jacket.I've added pictures of the one loose thread, and one of the very small feathers that came out (the feather is so small it is hard to see).I've added pictures of how I layer the jacket with the fleece and the outer shell when needed.This is a good deal, has responsibly sourced down and is pretty well made.

Ask anyone who has spent over $1,000 on a Canada Goose jacket with 650 dfp down.There are better jackets that are much more expensive, but this jacket is a good jacket for $59.If the jacket had 2 of any of the following 3 features, I think it would be worth the retail price of $99:1) A hem drawstring, instead of the elastic it has.2) A zippered chest pocket (inside or outside) for a phone.3) a double zipper on one of the pockets, so the jacket can be stored in its own pocket.This jacket lacks all of those features. They are all pretty basic. If it had any 2 of those 3, I'd class it as a $99 jacket.This is not a jacket that will get you across Antartica on a dog sled, but it will meet the needs of many people out there. I've worn this jacket in weather ranging from 0º F to 45º F. Alone, it is good down to about 32º F, if it isn't freezing rain out. Below that temperature, I usually combine it with a fleece hoody underneath this jacket.It was 24ºF today on my way to work and I wore the fleece hoody/EB cirruslite down jacket combo and was pretty warm.  If it is wet out, I'll wear this jacket under a waterproof shell. The coldest weather, and I combine the three layers: Fleece hoody, down sweater, gore-tex shell. That can take me down to the 0º F easily. I'll see if I can use that combo even lower this January. It just hasn't gotten that cold yet.Workmanship is fine. Remember this is a $59 dollar jacket. I found one hanging thread I cut off. It wasn't a loose thread, just extra. The first few days, a few of the very tiny down feathers came out near some seems. I have had this with every down jacket I have owned. The very smallest feathers fit through the larger sew holes. It happens, but it doesn't really leak down.To sum it up, it is worth the price charged here on Amazon. You can get jackets with more feartures, but they cost more. You can get jackets with better down, or better fabrics but you won't get them for $59.Jackets like the Montbell Alpine Lite, REI Magma 850 2.0, or Patagonia down sweater have more features, better fabric and better down. They retail for $209 to $229. You'll see extra features like zipper storm flaps, zippered chest pockets, fleece lined collars, water resistant down and more on these other jackets. Features that are not present on this jacket. They also cost from $140 to $170 more than this jacket does.This is a great bargain for the price, it can be a really good part of any layered winter system, and you can buy 3 or 4 of these for the price of a high end brand name lite down jacket.I've added pictures of the one loose thread, and one of the very small feathers that came out (the feather is so small it is hard to see).I've added pictures of how I layer the jacket with the fleece and the outer shell when needed.This is a good deal, has responsibly sourced down and is pretty well made. If you want more features, there are plenty of other down jackets with more features."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Somewhat cheap and not durable,1.0,"Within a few days of buying, white feathers started coming out of the jacket from random places and the outside material is too delicate and prone to tear for daily use. Yes, it will keep you warm till it lasts ( unfortunately for me it is a couple of weeks). In my case, friction with the backpack led to a tear."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Great looking jacket but not happy with the quality!,2.0,"I bought this jacket for my son back in December.  We were pleasantly surprised by the style, fit and how warm it was in spite of the lightweight feel of the jacket.  This was exactly what he was looking for.  However, today I noticed there is a rip on the upper part of the jacket near the shoulder.  I’m afraid it’s going to get worse. He’s worn the jacket on and off during the last three months.  As far he knows he didn’t do anything to cause this rip.  As much as we love the jacket we are not happy with the quality.  I thought he would have at least been able to wear this jacket for the next couple of years.  Definitely not buying another Eddie Bauer jacket again.  So disappointing because I have been buying Eddie Bauer clothes for my family and I over the years and expected a good quality jacket."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Warm but thin and fragile,3.0,"This jacket does keep you warm and is very soft to the touch.But it's very thin and feels like it would rip if caught on anything even slightly.One of the reviewers said the inside pockets don't have any Velcro to close which makes sense because I think undoing the Velcro would rip the pocket right off.Also after about 2 or 3 weeks of light use, there are a few feathers coming out.  Don't know if this will continue or not.I do like the jacket but given the price I think they could have made it a bit sturdier.Not the level of quality I would associate with Eddie Bauer."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Light and warm,5.0,"I ordered the “Atlantic(Grey)” color and it’s navy blue, not grey. I still kept it because the color doesn’t matter much to me and it’s a good coat. Fits great and super light and comfy. Very warm and blocks the wind well. I’ve been comfortable in 40 degree weather and I’m sure it would be comfortable even lower if you’re active like shoveling snow."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Very pleased with this as my first down jacket,5.0,"This is my first 'puffy' down jacket and I have been very pleased with it overall.  I live in Arizona so most people would be surprised to think we would even need a down jacket here, but this is really great for the cool mornings and evening walks around the community.  It packs down really small and even comes with a small bag for storing it, which comes in handy if you want to throw this jacket in a messenger bag or small backpack.  I love the feel of the jacket overall - it feels like you're being hugged by a nice down sleeping bag all the time.  its amazing that its not TOO hot though either - it really seems to breath well.  There are times when I've worn it around my office at work without even recalling that I was still wearing it - but its just that comfortable overall.  As a camper, I also bring this on car camping type trips for lounging around in the evenings and at meals.  Considering that the outer material is very thin I'm hesitant to wear it hiking or backpacking because I'm afraid it would easily rip.  I also avoid wearing it around a campfire as a small tinder would easily burn a hole in the jacket and I don't want to risk it getting ruined like that.  Great jacket from a trusted vendor!"

Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Perfect for temps 20's-50's; some quality concerns (revised),4.0,"I live in Minneapolis, so have some experience with long winters. I've been looking for a light jacket that was a) comfy, b) warm enough for early/late winter excursions, and c) fashionable. This is it!First, the comfort is terrific. The down is super soft and very lightweight. So light that I was highly skeptical that it'd keep me warm, but it does. Good to bunch up as a pillow on a place, too.Next, the warmth value is good due to the down used throughout the jacket. Once the temp/wind chill dips into the teens and below, it's time to break out the full coat/parka. However, for anything in the 20s-50s, this is my new go-to jacket.Lastly, the jacket really looks good with just about anything. I'll wear it with jeans and a t-shirt on the weekends or chinos and collared shirts for work and the jacket fits the occasions. Also, a note on fit: I'm 6'0"", weigh 190 lbs, and like to wear slim fit shirts for work. I originally ordered a large, but felt that the middle section hung awkwardly. I returned it for a medium, and love the size.I'm very happy with the value. Your biggest ""headache"" will be to make sure you get the right size.*Revised after 2 months of usage*I just added the photo to show where a seam is starting to unravel. I downgraded my rating from 5 to 4 stars because of this. I still love the jacket for reasons listed above, and it's still a great buy for the price.

Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,"Exceeds the ""Michigan Winter"" Test",5.0,"I got this jacket in a Tall XL expecting it to be a comfortable walking companion for a nice, brisk Michigan Fall day. Unfortunately, Fall lasted about a minute before we were all thrust into the deep freeze: Sleet and snow and temperatures at freezing or below. This jacket exceeds what I expected. Great fit in the body and sleeves. If you dress smartly in layers, this light-weight down jacket will keep you toasty--and you'll look like a boss in it!"
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Very poor Quality,1.0,"Jacket fits well and is comfortable to wear. Unfortunately, after one hour of minimal use on normal conditions, it is already leaking down. Its external material it seems it is made off of very poor quality material and the puff material it has started to come out. At $60 price range this would seem like a bargain, specially from a brand like Eddie Bauer, unfortunately due to its quality $60 is way too expensive. This was my first and last time for Eddie Bauer brand products. I even think that these good reviews might be a hoax, or simply, i was unlucky and got the bad quality product."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,"Great buy at the Amazon price, but not worth retail price",4.0,"This jacket is a great bargain at the price it sells for here on Amazon.The retail price is $99, but the Amazon price is $59.

Unfortunately, Fall lasted about a minute before we were all thrust into the deep freeze: Sleet and snow and temperatures at freezing or below. This jacket exceeds what I expected. Great fit in the body and sleeves. If you dress smartly in layers, this light-weight down jacket will keep you toasty--and you'll look like a boss in it!"
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Very poor Quality,1.0,"Jacket fits well and is comfortable to wear. Unfortunately, after one hour of minimal use on normal conditions, it is already leaking down. Its external material it seems it is made off of very poor quality material and the puff material it has started to come out. At $60 price range this would seem like a bargain, specially from a brand like Eddie Bauer, unfortunately due to its quality $60 is way too expensive. This was my first and last time for Eddie Bauer brand products. I even think that these good reviews might be a hoax, or simply, i was unlucky and got the bad quality product."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,"Great buy at the Amazon price, but not worth retail price",4.0,"This jacket is a great bargain at the price it sells for here on Amazon.The retail price is $99, but the Amazon price is $59. This jacket is worth the Amazon price, but is not worth the full retail price. Eddie Bauer does regularly offer 40% off coupons that bring the full price in line with the Amazon price. Eddie Bauer also, occasionally, has a 50% off sale which would bring the price down to $49, that would be a really good bargain.If you want a good deal, pay the Amazon price. If you are in no hurry, wait for a 50$ off sale at Eddie Bauer.Why do I think this is a good deal? This is not the best down jacket you can buy. This should really be thought of as a 'down sweater' and not a jacket. This does not have a lot of features. This has good down, but does not have the highest quality down ( 650 dfp (down fill power) vs 850 dfp or 900 dfp.  This does not have down treated with a hydrophillic process to make the down more water proof. This does not have an outer shell of some super high-tech fabric like dyneema or pertex.However, this is a really good, bargain down jacket.It has quality down. when dfp ratings started being used, 400 to 500 was the most common, ordinary, jacket fill. 650 used to be considered very 'high end'. Most of the ultra-expensive coats and jackets that Canada Goose sells use 650 dfp down. Things have changed and the high end is much higher now, but 650 dfp is still good. Ask anyone who has spent over $1,000 on a Canada Goose jacket with 650 dfp down.There are better jackets that are much more expensive, but this jacket is a good jacket for $59.If the jacket had 2 of any of the following 3 features, I think it would be worth the retail price of $99:1) A hem drawstring, instead of the elastic it has.2) A zippered chest pocket (inside or outside) for a phone.3) a double zipper on one of the pockets, so the jacket can be stored in its own pocket.This jacket lacks all of those features. They are all pretty basic. If it had any 2 of those 3, I'd class it as a $99 jacket.This is not a jacket that will get you across Antartica on a dog sled, but it will meet the needs of many people out there. I've worn this jacket in weather ranging from 0º F to 45º F. Alone, it is good down to about 32º F, if it isn't freezing rain out. Below that temperature, I usually combine it with a fleece hoody underneath this jacket.It was 24ºF today on my way to work and I wore the fleece hoody/EB cirruslite down jacket combo and was pretty warm.  If it is wet out, I'll wear this jacket under a waterproof shell. The coldest weather, and I combine the three layers: Fleece hoody, down sweater, gore-tex shell. That can take me down to the 0º F easily. I'll see if I can use that combo even lower this January. It just hasn't gotten that cold yet.Workmanship is fine. Remember this is a $59 dollar jacket. I found one hanging thread I cut off. It wasn't a loose thread, just extra. The first few days, a few of the very tiny down feathers came out near some seems. I have had this with every down jacket I have owned. The very smallest feathers fit through the larger sew holes. It happens, but it doesn't really leak down.To sum it up, it is worth the price charged here on Amazon. You can get jackets with more feartures, but they cost more. You can get jackets with better down, or better fabrics but you won't get them for $59.Jackets like the Montbell Alpine Lite, REI Magma 850 2.0, or Patagonia down sweater have more features, better fabric and better down. They retail for $209 to $229. You'll see extra features like zipper storm flaps, zippered chest pockets, fleece lined collars, water resistant down and more on these other jackets. Features that are not present on this jacket. They also cost from $140 to $170 more than this jacket does.This is a great bargain for the price, it can be a really good part of any layered winter system, and you can buy 3 or 4 of these for the price of a high end brand name lite down jacket.I've added pictures of the one loose thread, and one of the very small feathers that came out (the feather is so small it is hard to see).I've added pictures of how I layer the jacket with the fleece and the outer shell when needed.This is a good deal, has responsibly sourced down and is pretty well made. If you want more features, there are plenty of other down jackets with more features."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Somewhat cheap and not durable,1.0,"Within a few days of buying, white feathers started coming out of the jacket from random places and the outside material is too delicate and prone to tear for daily use. Yes, it will keep you warm till it lasts ( unfortunately for me it is a couple of weeks). In my case, friction with the backpack led to a tear."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Great looking jacket but not happy with the quality!,2.0,"I bought this jacket for my son back in December.  We were pleasantly surprised by the style, fit and how warm it was in spite of the lightweight feel of the jacket.  This was exactly what he was looking for.  However, today I noticed there is a rip on the upper part of the jacket near the shoulder.  I’m afraid it’s going to get worse. He’s worn the jacket on and off during the last three months.  As far he knows he didn’t do anything to cause this rip.  As much as we love the jacket we are not happy with the quality.  I thought he would have at least been able to wear this jacket for the next couple of years.  Definitely not buying another Eddie Bauer jacket again.  So disappointing because I have been buying Eddie Bauer clothes for my family and I over the years and expected a good quality jacket."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Warm but thin and fragile,3.0,"This jacket does keep you warm and is very soft to the touch.But it's very thin and feels like it would rip if caught on anything even slightly.One of the reviewers said the inside pockets don't have any Velcro to close which makes sense because I think undoing the Velcro would rip the pocket right off.Also after about 2 or 3 weeks of light use, there are a few feathers coming out.  Don't know if this will continue or not.I do like the jacket but given the price I think they could have made it a bit sturdier.Not the level of quality I would associate with Eddie Bauer."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Light and warm,5.0,"I ordered the “Atlantic(Grey)” color and it’s navy blue, not grey. I still kept it because the color doesn’t matter much to me and it’s a good coat. Fits great and super light and comfy. Very warm and blocks the wind well. I’ve been comfortable in 40 degree weather and I’m sure it would be comfortable even lower if you’re active like shoveling snow."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Very pleased with this as my first down jacket,5.0,"This is my first 'puffy' down jacket and I have been very pleased with it overall.  I live in Arizona so most people would be surprised to think we would even need a down jacket here, but this is really great for the cool mornings and evening walks around the community.  It packs down really small and even comes with a small bag for storing it, which comes in handy if you want to throw this jacket in a messenger bag or small backpack.  I love the feel of the jacket overall - it feels like you're being hugged by a nice down sleeping bag all the time.  its amazing that its not TOO hot though either - it really seems to breath well.  There are times when I've worn it around my office at work without even recalling that I was still wearing it - but its just that comfortable overall.  As a camper, I also bring this on car camping type trips for lounging around in the evenings and at meals.  Considering that the outer material is very thin I'm hesitant to wear it hiking or backpacking because I'm afraid it would easily rip.  I also avoid wearing it around a campfire as a small tinder would easily burn a hole in the jacket and I don't want to risk it getting ruined like that.  Great jacket from a trusted vendor!"
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,but it fits great and looks cool,4.0,"Arrived today and too warm to wear, but it fits great and looks cool. It's very lite and soft!  I must be careful not to get it caught on anything, material seems delicate but I guess that is to be expected with these jackets. I am very pleased with my purchase!!! BTW, I am 6 feet 195 lbs and the Large fits spot on......."
Eddie Bauer Men's CirrusLite Down Jacket,Perfect for temps 20's-50's; some quality concerns (revised),4.0,"I live in Minneapolis, so have some experience with long winters. I've been looking for a light jacket that was a) comfy, b) warm enough for early/late winter excursions, and c) fashionable. This is it!First, the comfort is terrific. The down is super soft and very lightweight. So light that I was highly skeptical that it'd keep me warm, but it does. Good to bunch up as a pillow on a place, too.Next, the warmth value is good due to the down used throughout the jacket. Once the temp/wind chill dips into the teens and below, it's time to break out the full coat/parka. However, for anything in the 20s-50s, this is my new go-to jacket.Lastly, the jacket really looks good with just about anything. I'll wear it with jeans and a t-shirt on the weekends or chinos and collared shirts for work and the jacket fits the occasions. Also, a note on fit: I'm 6'0"", weigh 190 lbs, and like to wear slim fit shirts for work. I originally ordered a large, but felt that the middle section hung awkwardly. I returned it for a medium, and love the size.I'm very happy with the value. Your biggest ""headache"" will be to make sure you get the right size.*Revised after 2 months of usage*I just added the photo to show where a seam is starting to unravel. I downgraded my rating from 5 to 4 stars because of this. I still love the jacket for reasons listed above, and it's still a great buy for the price. Of course, I wish it'd hold together a bit better."

Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,READ BEFORE BUYING.,3.0,"I purchased this jacket for my husband's birthday. The pictures on this jacket look phenomenal and exactly like something he would wear - and the pictures on the ad are the exact same jacket you will receive, however it's very hard to decipher the texture that the exterior of the jacket is made of. We were expecting it to be a soft suede like cotton material and although it is soft, it's definitely more of a water repellent cotton that appears almost silky and shiny like a faux leather in person. It's a very well made jacket but the exterior was not at all what we were expecting. After inspecting the entirety of the jacket, all the buttons and stitches were perfect and the jacket had a nice heft and a very good looking cotton flannel lining that did exclude the interior of the arms. We can't tell you how the product will wash or last because we just received it but we were very surprised upon opening it because of the texture and appearance of the outside of the jacket.

We ended up returning it because it wasn't what we expecting or looking for, but again, if you are okay with that texture, this jacket definitely appeared to be quality.

They have the cotten lining on the shirt, the cheap plastic like lining that sticks to your arm at the slightest bit of moisture (including humidity from rain). Lets go ahead and tack on that theres NO INSULATION. You just have that rough phaux demin feeling junk on the outside.

As soon as I got it I tried it on and went to check myself out in the mirror. After roughly two hours of admiring said jacket, I was also pleased to note that my beard had grown two full inches and my voice had lowered a few octaves. I went outside to see how the material would feel in the somewhat mild weather that we were having when I noticed two bears had made their way into my backyard. So I grabbed the nearest diamondback rattlesnake I could find and began swinging it by the tail at one of the bears. Apparently they dislike this because the bear then proceeded to knock me to the ground and try to bite my arm. Luckily I had on this jacket! As the bear's teeth made contact with the jacket, no material gave way, and the bear continued to clamp until his teeth shattered into a million pieces. He curled into the fetal position and I knocked him around for a few minutes just because my cable was out. The other bear saw what happened to his bear buddy and apologized to me, did my dishes for me, and then promptly left before I decided to make him my rug. At this point in time my pants began to sag so I wound the diamondback through my belt loops and tied it off (I considered biting the head off first, but it makes for a nice belt buckle). I went inside, swallowed a few ribeyes, grabbed a 30 pack of bear, mounted my 6' tall pet wolf Tiberius Rex, and rode off into the sunset with actress Scarlett Johansson.Having had this jacket for almost a year now, that first day turned out to be a slow one.

Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,READ BEFORE BUYING.,3.0,"I purchased this jacket for my husband's birthday. The pictures on this jacket look phenomenal and exactly like something he would wear - and the pictures on the ad are the exact same jacket you will receive, however it's very hard to decipher the texture that the exterior of the jacket is made of. We were expecting it to be a soft suede like cotton material and although it is soft, it's definitely more of a water repellent cotton that appears almost silky and shiny like a faux leather in person. It's a very well made jacket but the exterior was not at all what we were expecting. After inspecting the entirety of the jacket, all the buttons and stitches were perfect and the jacket had a nice heft and a very good looking cotton flannel lining that did exclude the interior of the arms. We can't tell you how the product will wash or last because we just received it but we were very surprised upon opening it because of the texture and appearance of the outside of the jacket. The tags match up identically to the ad's listing of the jacket's material (Shell - 63% Cotton and 37% Polyester, Body Lining - 100% Cotton, and Sleeve Lining - 100% Nylon). And I am far from a professional when it comes to fabric but this jacket definitely has a shine to it and a soft, silky, water-resistant feeling that we were not expecting. Overall my husband said he would rate the jacket a 3/5 but I decided to give it a 4 star review because I don't believe the listing to be wrong or fraudulent however the jacket does have a different look in person. I took many angles and close ups of the jacket inside and out (although you still cannot tell the texture - but if you've ever worn a water-repellent jacket, you know exactly what I'm talking about). We ended up returning it because it wasn't what we expecting or looking for, but again, if you are okay with that texture, this jacket definitely appeared to be quality.

Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,READ BEFORE BUYING.,3.0,"I purchased this jacket for my husband's birthday. The pictures on this jacket look phenomenal and exactly like something he would wear - and the pictures on the ad are the exact same jacket you will receive, however it's very hard to decipher the texture that the exterior of the jacket is made of. We were expecting it to be a soft suede like cotton material and although it is soft, it's definitely more of a water repellent cotton that appears almost silky and shiny like a faux leather in person. It's a very well made jacket but the exterior was not at all what we were expecting. After inspecting the entirety of the jacket, all the buttons and stitches were perfect and the jacket had a nice heft and a very good looking cotton flannel lining that did exclude the interior of the arms. We can't tell you how the product will wash or last because we just received it but we were very surprised upon opening it because of the texture and appearance of the outside of the jacket. The tags match up identically to the ad's listing of the jacket's material (Shell - 63% Cotton and 37% Polyester, Body Lining - 100% Cotton, and Sleeve Lining - 100% Nylon). And I am far from a professional when it comes to fabric but this jacket definitely has a shine to it and a soft, silky, water-resistant feeling that we were not expecting. Overall my husband said he would rate the jacket a 3/5 but I decided to give it a 4 star review because I don't believe the listing to be wrong or fraudulent however the jacket does have a different look in person. I took many angles and close ups of the jacket inside and out (although you still cannot tell the texture - but if you've ever worn a water-repellent jacket, you know exactly what I'm talking about). We ended up returning it because it wasn't what we expecting or looking for, but again, if you are okay with that texture, this jacket definitely appeared to be quality.

Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,READ BEFORE BUYING.,3.0,"I purchased this jacket for my husband's birthday. The pictures on this jacket look phenomenal and exactly like something he would wear - and the pictures on the ad are the exact same jacket you will receive, however it's very hard to decipher the texture that the exterior of the jacket is made of. We were expecting it to be a soft suede like cotton material and although it is soft, it's definitely more of a water repellent cotton that appears almost silky and shiny like a faux leather in person. It's a very well made jacket but the exterior was not at all what we were expecting. After inspecting the entirety of the jacket, all the buttons and stitches were perfect and the jacket had a nice heft and a very good looking cotton flannel lining that did exclude the interior of the arms. We can't tell you how the product will wash or last because we just received it but we were very surprised upon opening it because of the texture and appearance of the outside of the jacket. The tags match up identically to the ad's listing of the jacket's material (Shell - 63% Cotton and 37% Polyester, Body Lining - 100% Cotton, and Sleeve Lining - 100% Nylon). And I am far from a professional when it comes to fabric but this jacket definitely has a shine to it and a soft, silky, water-resistant feeling that we were not expecting. Overall my husband said he would rate the jacket a 3/5 but I decided to give it a 4 star review because I don't believe the listing to be wrong or fraudulent however the jacket does have a different look in person. I took many angles and close ups of the jacket inside and out (although you still cannot tell the texture - but if you've ever worn a water-repellent jacket, you know exactly what I'm talking about). We ended up returning it because it wasn't what we expecting or looking for, but again, if you are okay with that texture, this jacket definitely appeared to be quality.

The other bear saw what happened to his bear buddy and apologized to me, did my dishes for me, and then promptly left before I decided to make him my rug. At this point in time my pants began to sag so I wound the diamondback through my belt loops and tied it off (I considered biting the head off first, but it makes for a nice belt buckle). I went inside, swallowed a few ribeyes, grabbed a 30 pack of bear, mounted my 6' tall pet wolf Tiberius Rex, and rode off into the sunset with actress Scarlett Johansson.Having had this jacket for almost a year now, that first day turned out to be a slow one. Great jacket, do recommend."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,NOT as pictured!!,1.0,"I bought this coat for my husband as a Father’s Day gift and it was the worst gift ever! It was nothing like what was pictured on the Amazon listing. It looks like a corduroy red/orange Women’s coat and even though I bought it in my husband’s normal size, size large, he could barely button it up. He took photos wearing the coat just to humor me and I have included them on this review.. I would absolutely not recommend this product! False advertisement! See the photos… Hope that helps!"
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,not good,1.0,"I have purchased this shirt in the past and had been happy with them. This one is not properly sewn!! The shirt has been washed and the hem does not sit straight. It was a gift and when it arrived, I checked the size and color which was what I ordered. Not untio it was washed did I know there was an issue. The tags are gone and so is the shirt (donated) since my husband will not wear it. Merry Christams to my husband"
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,Inferior Quality,1.0,"This item arrived neatly folded and packaged in a sealed plastic bag.  Upon opening the bag I observed threads of stitching hanging down the front of the jacket.  Tried it on and it barely fit.  It was supposed to be an X-Large Tall but  is definitely a Large.  Further observed poor quality stitching on the pockets after removing the jacket.  All in all a very poor quality item.  Don’t be disappointed, avoid it."
Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jacket,"Good quality, dont size down unless you have short arms.",2.0,"*Update 11/27/19: Got my normal size of Large. Cheese and crackers this thing is big. The medium was too short in sleeves but fit well on my 6' 1"" 180 lb frame. The large is like a boat. If you got a large belly and chest and thick arms you're good. All others the company had zero intentions for making this shirt/jacket for you. Too bad because I really like the style and quality but getting returned.*I sized down according to most reviews as I usually wear a large size even though Im thin (6' 1"", 180 lbs) so I got a Medium. The body fit great but sleeves too short. Soon as you raise your arms even slightly the cuffs creep up your wrists. Im afraid if I order a Large itll be way too wide and buyer-beware, the seller here charges $5 for a return... So basically if I try a large and it is way too wide then Im out $10 for nothing. Im docking the star review just for the return charge alone."
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Design Flaw,2.0,"Don't buy this jacket! I love the look, the feel, the quality of the material, and the warmth level. But, there is a serious design flaw in the jacket. The pocket zipper bottoms sit above the rest of the material and take all of the weight of your hands when you have your hands in the pocket. I am sending back my second jacket for return, even though I'd love to keep it. Both times, the zippers bust in the first few days due to the strain of normal wear. At first I tried to repair the zipper,on but then learned that no zipper could be successful sewed in the way it is. If the pocket zippers are not important, maybe you will love the jacket."
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,BUY IT BEFORE THEY DOUBLE THE PRICE,5.0,"The jacket does the chin guard well, the cuffs are solid and the attention to detail is superb.  The lining is there!!  I am used to a softshell with less warmth.  This jacket is best served with a layering system planned with this being a layer to provide some warmth.  I have a softshell that was easily twice the cost and certainly does not meet the standard of value this jacket presents.  So while I was taken sideways by how warm the lining can be, this is my own assumption and failure to pay attention to detail when ordering, not a fault I hold against the jacket.  So where are the super tiny flaws? or super tiny details done right?The cuffs are the easiest place on this jacket to find the smallest pros and cons on an otherwise AMAZING value proposition.The velcro on the cuff is great quality.  The hook and loop sides both are done spectacularly well.  On some jackets the ribbon base on the loop side of the velcro can be placed to far to the edge of the cuff presenting an abrasive edge to wear on your hands/wrists.  Not so on this jacket.  The spacing is superb.The hook side can have issues such as scratchy hooks, aggressive ribbon base under the hook velcro or other issues that create scratching and abrasions.  Not on this jacket.  They use a hook section that is a rubbery material with hooks that are more like little triangle tree stumps so nothing feels scratchy or abrasive at all.  The rubbery material has a friction grip feel on the back side so you can get some grip in the rain or cold, and the edges are smoothed over or rounded.The cuffs are where the issue of this jacket exists though, the small small issue.  The lack of internal elastic or section of elastic.  Basically the cuff is all fabric tube with velcro to seize it down for warmth or to close aorund your gloves during a snow covered wrestling match or w/e.  In some other jackets the sleeve would compensate for this adjustability with a touch of elasticity, and I know why.With this jacket if you cinch down witht he velcro then you may have to uncinch the velcro to get your hand back through the sleeve.  Therefore for a better day to day fit in the sleeve you would need to velcro both sleeves getting into the jacket then both getting out of the jacket.  Every time.  This of course is not reality and you can have them cinched down but not fully and slip your hand in and out, leaving the velcro where it is, and only need to adjust it if you want to cinch down the cuff completely.I know this is a very small nitpick more than a flaw, but I think if I point it out then you can understand the level of criticism I can bring to a jacket and to see this is the only thing to nitpick means the jacket for the price is an insane value proposition. They could definitely sell this jacket for double the price and still have great ratings and reviews.  It is an incredible jacket and value."
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,"Looks great, I’m hesitant about the quality.",3.0,"I love the fabric and the collar height on the jacket. I’m 5’11” 235lbs and all the weight is in my stomach. (I’m working on it) that being said the jacket fits pretty good, a tad tight around my stomach but that’s on me. I ordered an XL, I felt and still do feel that an xxl would swallow me. That being said my critiques have nothing to do with sizing and everything to do with quality. Within a couple wears (not my everyday jacket) the zippers in the pockets stopped working, and the pulls for all the zippers except the large bottom to top zipper had come undone. I’ve not washed it yet, but I’m kind of afraid to. If you need a nice looking jacket for a job interview or your quarterly sales meeting, this will do great. If you need a nice looking jacket to wear everyday, I’d maybe look elsewhere."
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Nice jacket with aweful zippers,2.0,"This jacket has it's ups and downs.Up: it’s comfortable, good wind and rain resistance, and looks pretty classy.Down: the zippers!!!!  The main zipper up the front is functional, but feels like it won’t last long.  Just too sticky to give much confidence that it will last.  The pocket zippers are no better.  One of them broke after less than a month, and the zipper pockets are otherwise a nice selling feature for me.I would gladly pay a little more to get quality zippers on this jacket, and would be likely to give it 5 stars then.  As it is, a jacket that won’t zip does not really serve its purpose."
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Great details and quality for the price.,5.0,"6’2” 230 lbs, 36 inch waist, 34 inch inseam - XL purchased. Fits well, bought XL to go over a fleece and it worked well. If you plan on wearing over a sweater only, or less you may fit into a L.Really good quality and great features at this price. Small things like zipper pulls, pocket lining, and trim matter to me and if they do to you you will like this jacket. It is warm and a good all-around jacket. Cut short enough that I can wear it in the car and it does not ride up. Looks cool in black."
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Near perfect winter jacket.,5.0,"Fits perfectly - wear for both winter running and casual wear in NYC.I'm 5'8 and currently 180 (was 200 earlier when I ordered) and the medium fits perfectly at both sizes. Blocks the wind effectively, so even in colder temps, if I'm wearing a wool sweater underneath I'm plenty warm. In the rain, the outer shell will get wet, but that doesn't pass through to the inside. Snow just blows off. Chest zip pocket is perfectly sized for larger smartphones (iPhone 7+ here)."
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,"Decent, falls short in the details",3.0,"I'd say 3.5 if I could.  For $35 - this jacket is surprisingly good. The fit worked well for me and I was surprised by the overall feel of the jacket - I would've expected to pay more for what I received.Why 3 stars?  The zippers on the side pockets are susceptible to coming off the tracks at the bottom of the pocket - so if you have your hands in the pockets, the zippers can pop off one of the tracks and leave you unable to zip your pocket at all until you fix them.  Of course, the jacket will still keep you warm (and so will the pockets) - but the zipper problem has frustrated me quite a bit and left me regretting my purchase.  It feels like a silly place for this jacket to fall flat considering everything it does right.Will everyone feel that way?  Probably not, so it you don't think you would don't let my review deter you.  It just happens to bug me!"
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Great product by Amazon essentials,5.0,"Great product by Amazon essentials, I remember hesitating because of the previous reviews.I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a good soft shell jacket. Not only does is it look good but repell water effectively which is something I was surprised about.The only complaint I have was about the quality of the zippers, mine in the right pocket is broken. But I think it deserves 5 stars because of what your getting for a low price."
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,Great jacket but consider going a size up,5.0,"For context I am 6ft3in 220lbs. This is a great medium jacket, the outer shell is exactly the texture I desired and resists wind even better than expected(live near the beach in VA so it's often windy). The liner is comfy and at first I was a little thrown by the mesh on the back with fleece lining the arms vs fleece throughout but realize it breathes better like this.Build quality and fabric is spot on.Ok, now for the cons. Sizing--I usually buy things in XL and I'm good but when this arrived even though I saw that I was within the specs on the sizing chart it was way too short and a little snug in the chest. The shell does not stretch like cotton so even after a few days of wearing it in the car and such it was obvious I had to change out for a XXL. The XXL arrived and it sizing is pretty much perfect save for having to tighten the cuffs slightly and tighten the waist bungee just a little to keep the back from sticking out off my butt.Some things I'd wish it had were inside pockets, all my other jackets have these and I like putting my wallet there vs back pocket now.Overall highly recommended but consider going a size up. In retrospect, I could have gotten both the XL and XXL on prime wardrobe and tried them both on like that and only paid for the one I kept and might recommend the same for others to be sure you get the right one."
Amazon Essentials Men's Water-Resistant Softshell Jacket,A great soft shell jacket for a good price.,5.0,"Honestly surprised by the quality of the item so far.
