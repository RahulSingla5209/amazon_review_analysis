0,"Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket, Camel, Medium",Perfect base layer,5.0,Exactly what I was looking for. I was looking for a water resistant light weight and warm base layer. This one fits great. 2 deep internal pockets. Zippers on external pockets. Well constructed. No issues so far. I plan to scotch guard it just to ensure its water resistant.Ordered Size Large.5ft 6200lbs
1,"Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket, Camel, Medium",Nice fit but still have to try out,4.0,"For the price I had to try.  I have an REI version of this jacket.  This version is a little bit more tough and rough it seems.  I was able to pack it in the bag it came along with.  I'm 150lb 5'6 and got a Small.  As you can see in the pictures it fits fine, the chest portion is a little snug as I wear a 38 jacket.  The waist portion has a lot of room left.  Two pockets on the outside and two on the inside.  I still have to try out during a colder night, but I think it'll get the job done!"
2,"Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket, Camel, Medium",Versatile light-mid weight jacket - perfect for multi-uses,5.0,"It's impossible to find anything I don't like about this jacket.  I'm completely surprised - especially because of the low cost.  I was not expecting this level of quality, look and feel.  I wanted a light weight jacket that could be layer under and especially for travel where space and weight is a concern and I didn't want to pay a lot of money for it.  I looked at a LOT of jackets and they were either too warm, too bulky or too cheaply made based on reviews.  And then I found this incredible jacket.It exceeded my expectations in all categories.  I would say the temp range is from 20-45 degrees with fairly minimal layering/under garments, but that will depend on just what you wear underneath.  It definitely does a nice job of breaking the wind, so with fleece underneath, it could be toasty at 15 degrees.  It's extremely comfortable - it barely feels like you are wearing a jacket at all.  I'm 6'1"" with a 42"" chest, 180 lbs, and a large fits perfectly with sufficient space for movement and a layer or two.  The length is perfect at just below the waist and the sleeve length perfect - I wear a 36"" sleeve.  As others have mentioned the collar does not turn down, but it is a pretty minimal collar and with this soft material, I find I really like the collar the way it is.  The material is soft and pliable and never feels stiff and uncomfortable.  I bought the Heather Green and it's really a nice color that has a great casual look and it's not that shiny look - it's kinda matte type finish.  I've gotten a lot of complements on it.  And when I tell people what I paid they are blown away.The jacket has two large lined and very deep exterior side pockets that zip and one large interior vest pocket that does not zip or close which is fine by me.  Velcro would have been annoying.  And finally, it comes with a separate bag with a draw string that secures the jacket when rolled up.  And the bag can attach to the inside coat hanger loop if you desire, which is how it came and the way I use it.  The water resistant feature is nice for drizzle and mist, but I'll wear it underneath a waterproof windbreaker in rainy conditions.  This will become my go to travel jacket.This is indeed a home run for Amazon Basics and I highly recommend this jacket."
3,"Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket, Camel, Medium",Solid jacket. On par with name brands for significantly less.,5.0,"Live in Georgia, so don’t need a blizzard proof jacket. Tested this jacket in the low 40’s in windy and rainy weather with just a long sleeve running shirt underneath. Toasty warm. Compares very favorably with a TNF Thermoball jacket I have, and I actually think this Amazon jacket is warmer. Seems to be solid construction. Can’t go wrong for $39."
4,"Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket, Camel, Medium",This Jacket is perfect,5.0,"I bought this jacket for my son last minute for a trip out of state.  I needed something fast as it was going to be very cold and all he had was a windbreaker/shell and sweatshirts.  Jacket came quickly and was perfect.  I ordered a large, he is 6'3, thin build and it fit him in the sleeves and body.  The length was great too.  The length was most likely such a good fit for his height due to him being very slender.  So if you are shorter but thicker the large would probably fit.  He wore the jacket the whole time over a sweatshirt and it kept him warm.  It is a basic no frills very plain jacket.  Just what he likes, no labels, bells or whistles.  At this price point you can not go wrong.  I ordered the black and it looked much like my Patagonia jacket.  Amazon basics does it again for me!"
5,"Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket, Camel, Medium",it actually fits,5.0,"I stand 6'2"" weigh 200 pounds.  with 35 inch arms I have to wear xxl for the sleeves.  this fits perfectly, you will probably not wear this in Chicago on state street in February but if you live in san Francisco you will probably wear it year round.  as with amazon basic it's well made."
6,"Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket, Camel, Medium","Loving It So Far, We'll See In A Month Or So",5.0,"I ordered this jacket more than a year ago, & so far it's been the best $40 I've ever spent on any single article of clothing. My friends have all been blown away by the light weight, & here in the San Francisco Bay Area it's all the jacket I need. The medium size fits me perfectly ( 5'10"", 180 pounds) & layers perfectly over a hoody if I need extra warmth. My only complaint, & it's a very tiny one, is that I wish one of the inside pockets were a little smaller. But, sized as they are, I can fit my pocket umbrella into one & my beanie cap into the other. When packed into its stuff sack it fits nicely into my backpack & I can leave it there for long periods, pull it back out, & it's ready to wear. I wear it all the time, there's been no sign of defects, & I love this jacket so much I'm likely going to order another in a different color. If your area's winters are really cold you'll likely want a heavier jacket, but if you live on the California coast you probably don't need anything heavier than this. Highly recommended, especially at this price!!!"
7,"Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket, Camel, Medium",Reliable Casual Jacket,4.0,"It's lightweight, seems well constructed and is reliable. I've worn it in temperatures as low as 13 degrees fahrenheit and it kept me warm. It's not one of those high-end down puffer jackets, but if you're looking for a lightweight jacket for being out and about in cold weather, this is solid. I've also heard of people stowing this jacket in its pack in their cars for emergencies, which is a great idea too."
8,"Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket, Camel, Medium",Good jacket for the money,4.0,"Looks good and is breathable, but will still keep you warm. They must have fitted this for a square person with a big belly though. The bottom flares out for anyone with a beer belly lol. On a lighter note, it is still a good product and my favorite thing about this jacket is how comfortable it is. 4 stars. Btw I am 6’3 at 205 and athletic and I bought the XL. A large would probably fit my body better overall but probably be too short and ride up at my waistUpdate:I ordered the large to see if it fit better and it was in fact too small in the shoulders and only went down to my belt buckle. Dang, right in between sizes. Oh well, I’m returning the large and keeping the XL. There is such a difference between the two sizes that I think my XL may just have been improperly measured when made and that’s why the belly sticks out; or maybe they just figured anyone bigger than a size large probably has a beer belly and accommodated lol. Still 4 stars for the price and comfort. I think the only reason I’m making a big deal about it is because my girlfriend gave me a hard time about my apparent beer belly and I’m hung up on it. Anyhoo, plenty of room to grow so pass me a Guinness ;)"
9,"Amazon Essentials Men's Lightweight Water-Resistant Packable Puffer Jacket, Camel, Medium",Size matters!,5.0,"First off, let me say that my whole family wears either Patagonia, North Face, or Columbia. Good stuff!....but I just can’t bring myself to spend $150+ dollars on a sweater or light jacket. If I was exploring Alaska or Northern Europe, then I would feel differently, but I’m not so I try and keep the expenses under control.I purchased this jacket on a whim and I’m quite happy with it. It’s light but surprisingly warm and with my rain jacket over it, I’ve never had even a chill. It comes with a little bag so it must scrunch up quite small although I’ve yet to attempt it. And a word about sizing. I usually buy a large, but after reading a number of reviews here, I decided to take their advice and go one size down. To all of you who suggested that, a big thank you. It fits perfect!"
10,Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,"Excellent price, actually waterproof, lightweight, functional and comfy.",5.0,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.


   Great coat. Lightweight and actually waterproof. Water lands on it, but the coat does not get wet. Zero soak. I love it. It has taken me years to find a waterproof coat in my price range. I’m a preschool teacher, so I can’t affoard gortex. But this was like $20? And I can take it to work every day, and if the weather decides to rain and I have to take the kids outside, it really makes it so much more bearable.  Love it."
11,Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Actually pretty good.,5.0,"I ordered an XL thinking that it would run small, but it’s actually a little roomy on me. The waterproofing seems very well done. Ample pocket space for whatever dumb things I feel like carrying.Addendum: I wore it fishing, wading in the rain, and I stayed plenty dry and warm with this on."
12,Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,NOT WATERPROOF,1.0,"I wanted to like this jacket, I'm tall and have long arms, usually things are too short for me in the sleeves but this fit great, little short on the tail end for a raincoat but it was acceptable.Love the color, it's actually neon or fluorescent green as opposed to yellow which is typically mislabeled but this is actually green.It is not however, waterproof.  I thought the weak link was going to be in the way the hood zips off the jacket, which is in fact one area of leakage I believe, however, if you look at the photos you'll see it also seems to leak where the seams are around the shoulder blades as well.I was out in pouring rain for about 8-10 minutes, it's less than two months old, I'm sad it doesn't work, looks really cool  but not waterproof I'm afraid."
13,Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Good Jacket to wear over warm clothes,5.0,"A great rain coat for the price. Beware, however... As the description states this is a ""shell"" type of jacket. The lining inside this jacket is not intended for warmth but to keep the rain from soaking through. And let me tell you...it DOES a great job of doing that! I bought this in an XL to wear over a sweatshirt, and it does that perfectly!"
14,Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Poor cuff closure design.,3.0,I'm 5'9 165lbs and I ordered a medium. It fits me well. I wear it while I power wash on cooler days and have stayed dry so far after a few uses. What drives me crazy is the sleeve closure design. I have an average or greater than average sized wrist and the placement of the Velcro is very poorly designed. See attached photo. I'm going to ask my wife if she can fix the issue so I don't have to go through the troubles of returning the jacket. If they could just either add more Velcro or move the current piece I would've given 5 stars for the price I  paid. The jacket allows room for layering and plenty of room in the sleeves.
15,Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Nice lightweight jacket,5.0,"Seems like a decent lightweight jacket. Wouldn't keep you warm but light enough that you could bundle layers of clothing underneath if needed. My son liked it, not sure how waterproof it really is.I wanted to replicate a typical Florida rain storm so I pushed my son in the pool wearing it and his clothes were soaked when he climbed out"
16,Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Twice As Good,5.0,"I purchased one of these in dark grey, liked it so much that I bought another one, this time the black camo.While the sleeves are ridiculously long, better that than too short, and they can be tightened to preference with the velcro strips at each wrist.I usually wear a Large, but ordered the Medium and am glad I did.  It's a little tight across the midsection (my diet?) but other than that the Large would have been too bulky and even longer in the sleeves.I really like the quality of construction and the attention to the little things that make this jacket work for me.One of those things are the deep, zippered, side pockets.  When I insert my man-sized hands into them, they easily cover well above my wrists.  The interior breast pocket is also zippered, and large enough for the few things (like masks) that I use them for.The entire interior of the jacket is lined and breaths very nicely.  The jacket is light, the hood removes easily, and it can be zippered all the way up under the chin, or loosely closed with several well-placed velcro strips down the front of the jacket.I can attest to the jacket being wind-resistant, but haven't really given it a downpour to test it's waterproofing or lack thereof.  I wanted something light, comfortable, durable, and warm with the right layering and this jacket hit all of those marks.It's also a little longer overall, which is good thing for backside coverage.If these are really waterproof, I will be totally pleased.  No matter what, I'm satisfied."
17,Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Great Rain Jacket (5 Stars) - Weird Wrist Strap (-1 Star),4.0,"X-Large clothing can be tight or loose on me, so I chose to get the X-Large size jacket. It has a little more room than normal and the sleeves are a little on the long side (I have short arms). So, true to size is correct.The only issue that I have found, so far, is the weird wrist strap. The weird velcro strip and the anchor strip location is not good for a normal size wrist. If your wrists are as wide as your bicep, then there is no problem. Somebody else also mentioned the weird wrist straps, so it seems to be a production thing. Fix that weird design and it gets 5 stars."
18,Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Just What the Doctor Ordered 5,5.0,This was perfect to block the wind as I rode downhill along side of a mountain.
19,Men's Lightweight Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket Outdoor Raincoat Shell Jacket for Hiking Travel,Very Good Jacket for Coaches on Rainy and Windy Days,5.0,"This jacket blocks rain and/or wind very well. Half the battle of staying warm is to have the wind blocked and to not get drenched by rain. This jacket does very well in allowing you to stay warm.There are a number of zippered pockets that are helpful if you like to keep certain items grouped together, or keep certain items separated.The hood is a nice feature - it is not some kind of magical hood, but it is waterproof.  Don't go thinking that the hood eliminates water or wind problems for the head. The hood is not adjustable, and does not have any kind of adjustment means to keep it snug around your head.  So if you are required to be facing into the wind because you are watching a game, the hood will come right off your head like a kite.The jacket does not breathe. Heat or water vapor does not magically vent through wonderful microscopic holes. You can get hot in the jacket if you wear it for too long. So you will need to periodically use a low tech solution - unzip the jacket and flap it a few times to release the heat, and then rezip the jacket. Yes, you did pay $35 for the jacket, and no, you did not pay an extra $200 for the magic fabric that invisibly vents heat and water vapor.If you can't adjust the wrist cuff diameter, the cuff flaps around and lets the cold air shoot up the inside of the jacket, from the wrist all the way up the sleeve. So most people will end up sticking their hands in the jacket pockets, but not realize that this is because their cuff is scooping cold wet air up the arm, and this is because their wrist cuffs are not adjustable. LOL! Anyway, there is an absolutely cheap a** adjustment strap at wrist cuff so you can tighten the cuff at the wrist.  It is a horribly cheap, and cheap looking, yet awesome feature."
20,"Legendary Whitetails Men's Marksman Bomber Jacket-Outerwear Quilted Lined Full Zip Hooded Regular Fit, Kelp, Small","Stylish jacket, warm insulation",4.0,"Pros: Smart-looking jacket, quilted lining keeps me warm in cool weather; would not work in really cold weather. Large side pockets. Strong zipper. Sizing: Size L is a comfortable, snug fit on me, 5' 8"" 190 lbs. Over this, you'd need XL or larger.Cons: I didn't see/know it has an attached hood, but that's OK for keeping my head warm. But there isn't a drawstring for the hood so it easily slides off my head, any slight breeze would dislodge it. Should have included a drawstring. Easily remedied: I poked two holes in the double lining of the hood, ran a string through it and pulled a 36"" shoelace through, now I have a drawstring to keep the hood secure. An integral drawstring and I would have given it five stars."
21,"Legendary Whitetails Men's Marksman Bomber Jacket-Outerwear Quilted Lined Full Zip Hooded Regular Fit, Kelp, Small",Good jacket from a good company,5.0,First impressions: it's a handsome jacket in my opinion. It seems to be a pretty decently warm jacket so far for how lightweight it is. It kept me pretty warm today with only an insulated sweatshirt underneath despite the -35⁰ wind-chills today. This is the second coat I've owned from this company and I pretty much love my other one. That coat has gotten me through 4 midwest winters with no complaints by me
22,"Legendary Whitetails Men's Marksman Bomber Jacket-Outerwear Quilted Lined Full Zip Hooded Regular Fit, Kelp, Small",Not bad for the money.,4.0,The hood does not lay flat as in your pictures. It sticks out like wings. Otherwise good jacket. Would be better if hood was detachable.
23,"Legendary Whitetails Men's Marksman Bomber Jacket-Outerwear Quilted Lined Full Zip Hooded Regular Fit, Kelp, Small","Good jacket, not great.",4.0,"Good jacket. The XXL fits good with room to spare for sweatshirts and sweaters. I wish the pockets were bigger for my hands but other than that, it’s pretty good."
24,"Legendary Whitetails Men's Marksman Bomber Jacket-Outerwear Quilted Lined Full Zip Hooded Regular Fit, Kelp, Small","Nice style, great value.",4.0,"This was a value that I couldn't pass up. It is a good looking style, perfect for the winter weather ahead."
25,"Legendary Whitetails Men's Marksman Bomber Jacket-Outerwear Quilted Lined Full Zip Hooded Regular Fit, Kelp, Small",Definitely recommend,5.0,"I bought this jacket for my husband, and it is a very nice looking jacket and he says it is extremely warm for the weight and comfortable."
26,"Legendary Whitetails Men's Marksman Bomber Jacket-Outerwear Quilted Lined Full Zip Hooded Regular Fit, Kelp, Small",Great 👍🏻 winter jacket,5.0,"Great 👍🏻 Jacket for the cold 🥶 and rainy days 🌧.Multiple pockets is perfect to carry your belongings, Phone, wallet, car keys 🔑 👍🏻"
27,"Legendary Whitetails Men's Marksman Bomber Jacket-Outerwear Quilted Lined Full Zip Hooded Regular Fit, Kelp, Small",Great coat recomend buying,5.0,Great jacket warm in cold light in warmer weather liked it would buy another I got a 4x fit perfect
28,"Legendary Whitetails Men's Marksman Bomber Jacket-Outerwear Quilted Lined Full Zip Hooded Regular Fit, Kelp, Small",Perfect,5.0,"LOVE this jacket.  It’s light weight, lots of convenient and secure pockets, comfortable."

30,Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Came with free Amazon OpsTechIT logo,4.0,"Was I supposed to get the Amazon OpsTechIT logo on this jacket? I don't mind, I'll just be wearing it around the house, but just be aware that the $30 jackets may come with logos you didn't expect."
31,Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,"Great quality, looser, relaxed fit",5.0,"I just tried it on and really like it.  Great quality.  The collar can be zipped up or it can lay flat like a traditional jacket.  The large size fits me great.  I like the strong and thick elastic near the wrists.  (The sleeves don't just hang.)  It's a little loose in the chest and arms, but that's fine with me, as I like a more relaxed fit.  The two interior pockets are pretty loose, but are deep and would hold a lot.To give a better idea of the fit, I'm 6'3"" and 185-190 lbs.  So, tall and skinny with long legs.  If the length of the torso material was any shorter, I'd search for a size large tall.  I hope this helps someone :-)"
32,Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,"Felt, not fleece",2.0,"While the cut and stitching are good, the fabric is not really fleece, but rather a kind of felt:  ""A cloth or stuff made of matted fibers... fulled or wrought into a compact substance by rolling and pressure  ... without spinning or weaving."" The inside fibers are loose, not firmly attached: I can pinch them into a clump with my fingers. I attach photos comparing this coat with my 10 year old Columbia fleece.  I wondered if this is one of the counterfeits people mentioned.  This review describes the fabric, with a photo of the interior that looks like what I received: ""The inner face of the fabric has a felt-like feel that’s very soft and the outside is a low-pile shaggy fleece (think Mountain Hardwear Monkey Man, but less shaggy). ... After a couple weeks of wear and two nights on the trail, the Steens Mountain is still in great shape, even with me: a notorious spiller and snagger.""  Perhaps it is actually o.k.?"
33,Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,"Looks great, the price was great, doubt it’s real Columbia.",5.0,"I ordered this for my boyfriend. I ordered a large. First of all, I was so pleased because it arrived the next day after I ordered it. It was supposed to arrive tomorrow or on Saturday, but it just arrived a few minutes ago. He has not tried it on yet, he will in a bit, but I can already tell the large will be a bit roomier on him. He has really long arms so my concern is whether this will cover his arms. If the body fits well, usually the sleeves are a few inches too short. He does typically wear Large. The stitching looks fine, don’t see anything wrong with it. I do agree that the material is not actually fleece, it’s fleece-like. Feels thin but warm. Isn’t super fluffy, which is fine. My order says made in Bangladesh, which the reviews keep saying is the better quality zip-up in comparison to the ones that say made in China.If I don’t forget, I will update the review once he wears it a few times and once it’s washed to see how it holds up. But so far, other than it being fleece-like, it looks great for the price.I don’t know if it’s real Columbia though. I typically wear north face fleeces so I don’t even know what Columbia’s fleeces feel like. I doubt it’s the real thing.UPDATE 12.29.18: it fits him well, it’s very warm. He wears it almost every day when it’s colder outside. Has been washed a few times, still looks fantastic. Did lose the shiny new look after being washed, but it still does the job. We ended up buying the same one except black at TJMaxx for his brother for Christmas. Sometimes I wear it myself because it’s big and cozy; perfect for chilly days or lazy mornings."
34,Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Fits a few sizes smaller than listed.,2.0,"Shiping was fast due to Prime and the item was true color, but not true to size. I am extremely disapointed with this fleece jacket. I normally wear a 3XL or 4XL and i know fleece jackets can fit tight sometimes so i wanted one I could be comfortable i , one with some extra room. So I ordered a 5XL....nope this thing fits lile its a 3XL, the sizing is wayyyy off. I look like an overstuffed chimichanga."
35,Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,"2XL/Tall fits well for 6'5"" 280 lbs broad shoulders",4.0,"I got black but the black is a sort of matte black (dark, dark graphite).After reading some of the reviews, I decided to order the 2XL/Tall instead of my normal 3XL/Tall and it's a good fit.I'm 6'5"", 280 lbs, with broad shoulders and carry a bit of weight in the belt, but the 2XL/Tall fits well without being too tight.The Steens jacket isn't the warmest or the best but I got it to throw on, look good, and knock the chill off 40F+ and it works well."
36,Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Not lined!,3.0,"It appears to be a good, lightweight jacket.  However I my biggest complaint with it is that it is NOT LINED  This causes it to stick to EVERY single shirt I wear when I put it on or take it off!  AND, wind just cuts right through it because it has no lining.  This morning going into work it was 37 with a moderate breeze.  My teeth were almost chattering by the time I walked the hundred feet from the parking lot to the front door.  It was like I wasn't even wearing a jacket!  Add a lining to help eliminate wind passing through and to keep it from sticking to shirts and it would be almost perfect."
37,Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,A warm versatile fleece for spring and fall or for layering in winter,4.0,"The jacket was delivered as ordered and shipped as estimated. The fleece feels very soft and a decent weight. I bought the large and it fits perfectly. Not too baggy and not too tight. I am 6 ft 1 in and 190 lb and athletic build. I bought this as a winter liner for another outer jacket. Note that this is not an interchange liner fleece, as it doesn't have the correct zipper to zip into an outer jacket. That detail was not important for me though. I already own a Columbia fleece jacket from a few years back that i use for outside projects on the home in mild and colder conditions, and i have always managed to stay warm with low to medium activity level. I have been so impressed with it i wanted to buy a second one. I compared the new one with the older one and both have the same retail number. However, the seams inside the new jacket are not finished in the same way or as neatly as the older one. The new jacket is made in Sri Lanka but the older one is made in Vietnam. I have noticed a similar thing regarding quality of finish with other clothing manufacturers. Where things are made really does seem to matter. This issue is very minor and doesn't show on the outside and looks like a quality fleece when you wear it. There is an elastic draw cord and toggle for people like me who like to cinch around the waist. The older jacket had two, this has only one on the left side. Works the same. Pockets have zippers all YKK and little cords that you can attach to make opening and closing with gloves easier. All in all a good product, but i personally wouldn't pay the full price of $60 for it, i got it at half price on sale and am happy with that."
38,Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,"Great Jacket, buy according to Columbia size chart.",4.0,"Great fleece jacket, fits well and sleeves are just my size. I'm 6'0"" and 174 lb slim built but broad shouldered and a Medium fits me great. Warm and comfortable fleece, light weight. Only issue is Amazon shipped the wrong color, I ordered black and I received dark Gray. Decided to keep it anyway because I liked the color. Quality jacket at a great price.Note: This particular Steens Jacket is the 2.0 updated version even though I ordered the original old version. Seems Amazon sells both as same style. I don't believe they have much difference in style. But I got packets with zippers and draw string at the Hem. those might be the updates of the 2.0. I wasn't expecting zip pockets."
39,Columbia Men's Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket,Fake!,1.0,"This is a counterfeit Columbia fleece. First off, not fleece, secondly, it smells like chemicals, third the tag is sewn on the front and not embroidered, the zipper pulls are not the ones Columbia uses. I’ve seen fake North Face Fleeces on eBay but never from something as inexpensive as Columbia.  The material is so cheap I bet it won’t last through more than 2 washes and will pill up immediately. Also smells like it gives you cancer."
40,Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Fake Jacket,1.0,"The jacket I received is a fake.  I also ordered a tall to compared the lengths.  See pictures.  The tall jacket is on the left off the 1st 3 pics and the bottom on the last.  The fake jacket does not have Columbia embroidered, it is a sticker of some sort.  Also the tag on the inside is different as with the ""Omni-tech"" on the sleeve.  The fake jacket does not have ""Packable"" on the inside of the pocket.  The jacket appears nice and I would have not questioned its authenticity if I didn't have the tall jacket to compare.  I am returning it."
41,Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Columbia or Amazon couldn't verify counterfeit,1.0,"Based on the other reviews I couldn't verify if the item I received was authentic or counterfeit. I got a replacement and both items had a non embroidered chest logo, missing packable tag in the pocket, and a non diamond omnitech logo on the left sleeve.I called Columbia and the best they could do is verify that the product number on the tag matched the number in their system, which it did. They couldn't address the concerns listed above.I contacted Amazon and they also couldn't verify if the product was authentic or counterfeit and will open an investigation."
42,Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Nicely Made (and a word for you if you're on the L/XL line),5.0,"I am on the border of large and x-large with most my clothes (36"" give or take waist). From other reviews, I read it's a little big, so decided to size down and went for the large. It fits nice with a t-shirt underneath, but not a lot of extra room for my... ugh... expanded mid section.  With a fleece mid-layer, it's a bit snug me. So if you're right on that L/XL line in most your clothing due to an over-indulgence in yummy trail treats and plan to wear over thicker clothing, I'd go with the XL.  But if you plan to be using it as a summer raincoat over just a tee for hiking and so on (that's my plan with it), then I'd go with the L.  It's really that fine of a line for me."
43,Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,NOT Waterproof at all!!!,1.0,"I bought this to go hiking on the Inca trail in Peru.  Even though it was rainy season, luckily we had no rain.But, then I took it on a trip to NYC where I wore it during a rainstorm on the way to a house lunch.  Was dry for the 15 minute walk in light but steady rain.  Hung the jack up to dry.  When I went to put back on the jacket, the moisture had SOAKED ALL THE WAY THROUGH the entire jacket.  Like putting on a wet washcloth.  Very disappointing.The jacket looks nice, feels well, but most sincerely very NOT WATERPROOF AT ALL.Never washed or did anything with jacket.Seller:  If you think I got a bum jacket, please let me know.  Would try another to see if works."
44,Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Great jacket!!,5.0,"My husband loves this jacket. It is actually waterproof. My husband mountain bikes as a hobby and he volunteers to build the trails. Rainy days are the best trail building days and he said this jacket kept him completely dry while he was working in the rain for hours. On sizing if you are barely a large size down to a medium. The large runs big. My husband is 5'10"" 170lbs and medium fits him perfect. The large fit my brother inlaw perfectly and he is 6' 220lbs for reference."
45,Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Incrediblé jacket,5.0,"Had this jacket for about a month now and all I can say is it's awesome! Perfect for rain and a pretty damn good wind breaker as well. I can't say it's completely waterproof because I haven't been in a monsoon rainstorm but it's kept me dry for every other rain storm. Also it packs up so if you don't need it right now but maybe later for like a camping trip or something you can pull it out and put it on.Instructions: the left pocket has a label inside that says ""packable"" turn that guy inside out and stuff the rest of the jacket on in there.About the size of a normal picture 6""x4"" and the width of maybe 3-4"" probably depends on how well you stuff it in there. Hope this helps!"
46,Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,More Than a Rain Jacket,5.0,"A Review of the Columbia Men’s Watertight Rain JacketThe Columbia Men’s Watertight Rain Jacket is a lightweight waterproof jacket with a slim design. As the name suggests, the jacket is very much capable of keeping you dry on a rainy day; however, its value goes way beyond a rain coat. Here are several features that make this jacket a wonderful addition to your wardrobe.Waterproof and WindproofThis jacket is truly waterproof. It helps you stay clean and dry even in the pouring rain. With the waterproof technology comes the wonderful stain repellent feature. No matter how dirty the jacket gets during a rainy day, a simple wipe is enough to take care of it. The windproof feature provides an extra protection against the cold. Meanwhile, the fabric is still breathable that it allows moisture vapor to move away from the skin. The only downside is that the waterproof feature can post difficulty when it comes to washing this jacket. You may find a pouch of water when you take it out of the washer. An extra cycle of drying will take care of the issue if this ever occurs.DesignThis jacket is lined with a soft layer of mesh and is very light weight. The longer arm length and body length provide enough coverage to keep you dry no matter how hard the wind is blowing. The hood comes out far enough forward to shield your face while the drawstring helps keep the hood on even in strong wind. Two front pockets with zipper are big enough to protect a phone, a wallet, a set of keys, and even a pair of gloves from getting rained on. The slim design delivers a more modern look than its competitors, helping you keep the style even on an awfully crummy day. Meanwhile, the jacket is still generous with space around your chest so that you always have enough room for a sweater or a hoodie or even a coat. Another notable feature is that the entire jacket can be packed into the front left pocket, which comes with a double-sided zipper.VersatilityFew jackets are as versatile as this one. The waterproof and windproof features make this jacket practically perfect for a fishing trip. The breathable fabric makes sure that you can throw this jacket over your favorite tee on a rainy day in the middle of the summer. You can also layer up under this jacket for fall or winter use. The matt finish and the slick look ensure that no one knows you are using a rain jacket as a spring/fall windbreaker. You can also use this jacket to protect your pea coat from getting wet on a snow day.Overall, the Columbia Men’s Watertight Rain Jacket is a high quality jacket that can be worn in many occasions. It surely has room for improvements. But for the price you are paying, you can hardly find a better deal than this."
47,Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,It's waterproof and keeps the wind out while being lightweight.,5.0,"I bought this jacket for my husband who is 5'10' and about 200 lbs.  It's a bit roomy as I wanted him to be able to fit a fleece jacket under it when needed.  It is loose enough without being baggy to look good with or without the fleece.  He's worn it a bit likes the feel and says it keeps the wind out.  It finally rained to test out the waterproof part - it's waterproof all right!  We stood out in the rain about 4 hrs, some of it was drizzle, most a steady rain. His shirt was dry when he took the jacket off.  His only wish was the hood was a bit stiffer at the top.  He said it kind of plastered around his head instead of creating a hood that stood out a bit.  His solution is to get a baseball hat and that will keep the rain off his face.  I would buy it again for sure!"
48,Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,Doesn’t appear authentic,1.0,"The jacket doesn’t appear to be authentic. It doesn’t have Columbia embroidered on the front and the sleeve like as on an original, it is more like a iron onto shirt like sticker of some sort. Also the tag on the inside is different like a general cloth label which doesn’t have the Columbia brand and QR code like on the original. Same goes for the ""Omni-tech"" on the sleeve. This jacket does not have ""Packable"" pocket on the inside of the left pocket with a label. Also like many customers reviewed, these jackets are oversized. Maybe good for people who live in colder climate wearing layers. For petiole living in temperate climate areas I would suggest you order one or two size smaller. This The jacket appears nice but I would not have paid this much if I wanted a regular unbranded jacket."
49,Columbia Men's Watertight Ii Jacket,"Authentic Columbia, I own 2",5.0,"Rumors of counterfeit had me wondering but I can confirm that this is an authentic Columbia watertight2, I called Columbia and was told it was probably fake because of lack of inside pocket and certain numbers so I kept the amazon jacket and ordered another one directly from Columbia and guess what, This is not a fake, Columbia no longer embroiders the name or puts inside pockets on this jacket, the 2 jackets are identical 😃 I am roughly 6 feet 225 pounds, XLT fits loose which I wanted, XL fits snugger but still perfect if I’d get in shape, I recommend This as an authentic jacket for cheeeeap if you like the right color😄"
